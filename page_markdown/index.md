## Introduction

I'm Henry Blanchette, and this is my personal website.
Currently, I'm a PhD student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu).
Read [about](/page/about.html) my background in more detail ([research](/page/about.html#research), [education and employment](/page/about.html#education-and-employment)).
I'm a researcher and programmer focused on:

- developer tools for proof development and software engineering using [type theory](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/emacs-mode.html)
- [programming language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory)
- [formal specification and verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification.)
- [user interface design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design)
- [mathematical modeling and simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

I am also especially interested in:

- developer tools for proof development and software engineering using [ML models](https://zed.dev/acp)
- [game design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design)
- [economics and game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)

See my [library](/page/library.html) of public writings on various topics usually related to my interests.
