## Overview

I am a programmer and researcher focused on:
- [programming language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory)
- [formal specification and verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification.)
- [mathematical modeling and simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- [user interface design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design)
- [game design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design)
- [economics and game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)

## Research

My research interests have centered around programming languages, simulation, mathematical modeling, and data analysis.
