<p><u>Abstract</u></p>
<p>A day in the life of a student at a most practical university.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I awake to a bird chirping musically outside my window. The sun
shines through my ajar blinds, causing me to shield my freshly aired
eyes. Another beautiful morning! I throw off my blanket and sit at the
edge of my bed, attempting to remember what class I have first today.
What is it again?... is it Personal Finance? No, I had that already this
week. I sigh in relief --- I dislike Personal Finance the most of all my
Practical Economics classes. But all things considered, it's a good
thing I'm learning it now.</p>
<p>Looking down from my window, across the disheveled yard, I see my
friends gathered around the old car. I need to get ready to go! I don't
want to miss my ride. The 45-minute drive is always a pain, but being
with friends helps the time pass quickly. I throw on some clothes, grab
my backpack, and rush down the stairs. I start walking towards the car,
and notice that my friends aren't dressed at all appropriately for
class; they are wearing business casual. I ask them what's up, and they
give me the update: they're cutting class in order to go looking for
jobs, and they really need the car, so I need to walk to school.</p>
<p>I've argued with them about this endlessly --- I firmly believe that
getting a good degree is the most effective way to start off a good
career. But they are never convinced. Sporadically they try different
strategies, sometimes leaving me to take the bus to school. I think that
Friend1 and Friend2 are in the same morning Chemistry class, and they've
definitely missed more than the 30 allowed absences. So maybe they've
finally decided to just drop it. Ah, that's right! This morning I have
<em>Psychology</em>. But now that I have to take the bus, I'm definitely
not going to make it. Oh well. There's only around five weeks left in
the semester though, so it was probably going to be another exam prep
day. I'll ask Friend3 for their notes when I see them in Interviews.</p>
<p>I didn't make it to <em>Psychology</em>, but now here I am in
<em>Interviews</em>. I managed to get into one of the smaller sections,
so there's only about 500 people enrolled. Today is practice day, so
we've got a good turnout of something like 300 --- including Friend3! I
ask them about Psychology this morning, and they give me the link to the
professor's online slides. Looks like the url is from GoodSchool1!
That's great, I'll probably do well then.</p>
<p>Today's practice day is for "One-on-One Job Interviews". I've been
looking forward to this because I want to look for a better job this
summer after I graduate. Right now I'm a dishwasher at Restaurant1,
which I just managed to get because they knew I'd be graduating so soon.
I wait patiently for 20 minutes as the teaching-assistants finish
passing out the instruction sheets to the entire lecture hall. The
professor lists the best strategies for a good one-on-one job interview:
- be confident - bring a copy of your resume, CV, and transcript for
reference - mention you took <em>PFIN 376 - Honors Job Interviews</em> -
list your extracurriculars - list your best previous job experience</p>
<p>Fortunately the professor is reciting the same material from the
instruction sheet, so I can easily reference them during the practice.
Now it's time to start; I decide to be the interviewer first. I ask
Friend3 some questions from the instruction sheet, and they answer.
Everything goes really well! Then we switch positions and repeat the
exercise. We almost got through all 10 questions before the class ended,
so we had an especially productive session today.</p>
<p>Now the fun is over though. I hesitantly walk to my next class:
Personal Finance. At least I didn't have to start my day with it. I sit
down in the slightly-larger lecture hall with 700 other bustling
students. The lecturer today is a visiting financialist, who's making
the rounds to public universities in the state. Maybe this will be
something interesting and new. At the very least, it's delaying our
Deductibles exam.</p>
<p>It turns out the financialist's lecture is on how to use automated
tax-filing systems! I'm glad we're learning something so practical ---
what a treat! The financialist introduces us to a variety of systems,
including TurboTax, Zoho Books, and Credit Karma. Then they explain all
the pros and cons of each system, and which is the best for small
business owners. Like we could be someday. Finally, they demonstrate how
the automated-tax-filing process works, using TurboTax. The lecture is
very enlightening, and I feel much more prepared for a new job this
summer. I think I'll use TurboTax. As us students file out of the
lecture hall, we are pass out certificates indicating our attendance, as
is usual for Personal Finance lectures.</p>
<p>Finally, my last class of the day is <em>Well-roundedness</em>. As
everyone knows, there are crucial benefits to a well-rounded liberal
arts education. My school is not exclusively liberal arts of course,
since students need to gain practical skills for everyday life, but
well-roundedness is certainly one of those skills that are eagerly
sought after by employers.</p>
<p>The homework due today was to have read the Iliad and Odyssey ---
central classics of the ancient greek tradition. The professor only gave
us the weekend to read both, but of course they didn't expect us to read
it in depth anyway. The point is to get an exposure to a broad
curriculum, so we don't have much time to spend on any one text or
subject. We've got to be well-rounded! I meet with my conference of 24
students and one teaching assistant, and we discuss the texts. The
conference is only an hour and a half long, but it feels much longer. We
really cover a lot, even though only a few people contribute. I'm
guessing they probably read it before, but that's fine. I appreciate
their descriptions, and I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of the
ancient stories by the end.</p>
<p>It's been a long day of practical learning, but I still have one last
thing to do here at school. I sit in the waiting room for 30 minutes,
and then get a chance to knock on the Career Advisor's door. They say
they'll be available in a few minutes. 20 minutes later, I am invited
in.</p>
<p>The advisor conjures up my academic profile on their computer, and
skims it for a moment. Then they turn to me and we discuss my prospects.
I explain my aspiration to move up from my dishwashing position to be a
cashier. My advisor glances back at my profile, and recommends a
graduate accounting degree before I attempt applying for something like
that. And if I wanted to rise higher than that, I should enroll in an
over-graduate business degree while working my cashier job. That's all
very good advice, I realize I obviously didn't really know what I was
getting into. Most of the cashiers I knew have graduate accounting
degrees, so I should have guessed. I thank the advisor for their time,
leave their office, and tell the next student in the long line that it's
their turn.</p>
<p>After a relaxing bus-ride, I walk up the path to my house and notice
the car back in the driveway. My friends must be home already. I meet
them sitting in the living room, where they are watching TV and eating
popcorn. I pour myself a bowl and ask how the job-search went. No luck,
it turns out. They recall how most of the places they talked to had a
prerequisite of a university degree. Maybe they're finally coming over
to my side of the argument!</p>
<p>Given their results, they've decided to stop searching. They still
don't seem too excited to go to classes, but maybe they'll get so bored
hanging out here that they'll go anyway. They reason that the worst that
could happen is that they get a C in some classes, if they miss most of
them, but that's still passing. I point out that the material is
actually pretty useful and is worth learning, and they believe me, but
are still not motivated. Well, I've tried. At least things will work out
for me.</p>
