very novel and unique ways. Overall, after using Arc for about a month
on my Apple Macbook Air M2 instead of Safari, I've decided to switch to
it going forward as my default because it has so many great features and
only a few demerits.</p>
<p><img src="/asset/arc-browser-review/arc-search.png"
alt="arc-search" /></p>
<p>This post was written when Arc V1.33.0 was the latest version.</p>
<h2 id="good-features">§ <a href="#good-features"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Good Features</a></h2>
<p>The following are notable features special to Arc that I use
regularly.</p>
<h3 id="layout">§ <a href="#layout"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Layout</a></h3>
<p>One of the first things you'll notice that's new about Arc is the
layout. In contrast to typical browsers, Arc has the content stretch the
entire height of the window, and keeps tabs and other organizational UI
in a left sidebar.</p>
<p>While this is unconventional, I found it immediately felt much better
and has obvious advantages. - It’s much easier to keep track of a larger
number of tabs, since many more tabs with their full name and icon
displayed can fit vertically stacked in the left sidebar than most
browsers could keep horizontally stacked in a top tab bar. -
Additionally, in this layout, tabs don’t get smaller the more you have
of them. This helps me a lot with keeping a sense of intuitive spacial
allocation, where I can just remember where I left a tab that I had put
there before. - A setting allows you to automatically hide the sidebar
(it re-appears when the mouse hovers over the left edge of the window,
similar to the "automatically hide dock" feature on MacOS). This works
great with fullscreen mode, which is primarily how I use Arc. I
previously had my MacOS dock on the left side of my screen, but I had to
move it to the bottom in order to make it compatible with this feature
of Arc.</p>
<p>Since you can expect to see most the name of a tab without having to
click on it, it makes a lot of sense to rename tabs as well. Often
websites have features that name a tab based on some process happening
in the window, so I usually rename pinned tabs that I am always coming
back to in a way that’s easy to recognize immediately.</p>
<h3 id="tabs-today-pinned-favorite">§ <a
href="#tabs-today-pinned-favorite"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Tabs — Today, Pinned,
Favorite</a></h3>
<p>Arc comes with a new way to organize tabs within spaces. There are
three kinds of tabs: Today tabs, Pinned tabs, and Favorite tabs. - A
Today tab is meant to be mostly temporary — it shows up below Pinned
tabs in the tabs column, and is archived automatically after a certain
period of time (or this feature can be disabled). The idea is that while
you’re exploring a variety of webpages, you open each tab first as a
Today tab, and then as you recognize certain tabs as important that you
keep coming back to, you move them to Pinned to keep them around longer.
And if you keep the automatic archiving feature (I do) then the
unimportant tabs will clean themselves up over time. Sometimes I do have
to search my history for a tab that I realized was important later on,
but that isn’t too difficult and much more of the time the conscious
effort required to move a tab to Pinned is not too little or too much
friction to indicate that a tab is worth keeping (with one caveat —
integration with the Arc Sidebar mobile app). - A Pinned tab is meant to
be mostly permanent — it shows up at the top of the tab column of a
space, and stays there unless you explicitly remove it (delete it or
move it to the Today section). The normal tab close action will only
close the open instance of the tab, not remove it from the Pinned
section of the Space. Following a link from a Pinned tab opens as a
Today tab. - A Favorite tab is meant to be permanent and persistent — it
shows up as a larger tab in the Favorite tab table which is above the
Space’s tab column (they’re kinda like pinned tabs in Safari or Chrome).
As its position indicates, Favorite tabs are accessible from any Space.
Each Favorite tab’s name is the favicon of the website, blown up to be
very visible, rather than a text name. Following a link from a Pinned
tab opens as a Today tab in the currently active Space. You can set a
Favorite tab to be always loaded, so no matter what space you’re in or
if you restart Arc, you will get notifications from those tabs (I used
this for chats such as Slack and Discord). For some websites Arc also
supports some special features if you make them Favorite tabs. For
example, having a Favorite tab for Github will present on hover a list
of open PRs (clickable links) associated with you, and having a Favorite
tab for Notion will present on hover a list of recent notes (clickable
links).</p>
<h3 id="spaces">§ <a href="#spaces"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Spaces</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know about the kinds of tabs, we can talk about Spaces.
A Space is like a tab group — it contains a column of Pinned and Today
tabs. Everything about a Space is shown in the sidebar, and at the
bottom is the Space navigator which you can use to instantly switch
between spaces. The Arc window is not linked to a Space, so you can
switch spaces while staying in the same window.</p>
<p><img src="/asset/arc-browser-review/spaces.png" alt="spaces" /></p>
<p>Overall, spaces with today/pinned tabs are a great improvement over
tab groups and bookmarks in Safari (and other browsers, typically). If
there's a topic I know I want to keep open for a while: I make a new
space, name it appropriately, pin a few tabs that I will always come
back, and do less organized exploration with the Today tabs; when I
notice a Today tab is something I keep coming back to or I otherwise
want to remember it, I'll pin it, and otherwise it'll just disappear
over time which leaves the tab group nice and clean. This was a major
issue I had with tab groups in Safari — the tab group represents a
collection of interesting links, but as I open more and more it gets
more and more cluttered and its too annoying to navigate the links in
order to prune it to make it less cluttered. So eventually I just have
to make the "v2" of the tab group that represents my second attempt at
exploring the topic. And I have tons of tab groups I never come back to
since its just too annoying to preview a tab group without opening a
dozen tabs and going through them one by one to figure out what they
actually are.</p>
<h3 id="fast-tab-switching">§ <a href="#fast-tab-switching"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Fast Tab Switching</a></h3>
<p>Arc keeps track of tabs you've been to recently or opened in a new
tab. You can quickly switch between these with <code>CTRL+Tab</code>,
just like you would switch between applications natively in MacOS with
<code>CMD+Tab</code>. I use this all the time, almost always instead of
actually looking for a tab in sidebar as I'm quickly opening and closing
lots of tabs, and I can't believe other browsers don't have it, it just
makes so much sense. [<span><a

<h3 id="syncronized-window-instances">§ <a
href="#syncronized-window-instances"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Syncronized Window
Instances</a></h3>
<p>Not only is each Arc window not linked to a specific Space, but
Spaces are synchronized between all windows. That makes it so that for
the most part, I just need one main Arc window open at a time (in
fullscreen mode), and I just switch between Spaces within it rather than
managing multiple Arc windows or arrangement of Arc windows in desktops.
Then for Arc windows I have setup in splitscreen with other apps, when I
jump to that screen the Arc window is always up to date with whatever
I’ve added to that space.</p>
<h3 id="split-view-tabs">§ <a href="#split-view-tabs"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Split View Tabs</a></h3>
<p>You could use native MacOS splitscreening with multiple windows, but
Arc provides an even better feature of splitview tabs. Any tab can be
dragged onto another in order to arrange those tabs in a splitview
horizontally. Any number of tabs can be split like this. The new
combination tab acts like a single tab for the sake of tab navigation
and manipulation.</p>

<p>One of the differences between Arc and other browsers that comes up
the most is interaction with the URL bar. In Arc, there is no URL/search
bar at the top of the window (there is one at the top of the sidebar if
you choose to see it). Instead, you bring up the command bar using
<code>CMD+T</code>. The command bar is basically the URL/search bar but
with some extra features. The UI is really great though as it pops up
the command bar right in the center of the screen — big and in focus. -
searches tabs from any space (and archive), so you can just jump to the
open tab rather than open a new copy - starts a ChatGPT conversation
with the text as the prompt - trigger some extensions - example: I can
add a <span><a href="raindrop.io"><img src="/favicon.ico"
class="favicon" alt="/favicon.ico" />Raindrop</a><span

<code>CMD+T raindrop</code> and selecting the appropriate dropdown menu

(doesn’t work with other AI assistants (yet?)) * The command bar opens
the result in a new tab, but you can get the "in-place" version of the
command bar for the current tab via <code>CMD+L</code>, which appears
pre-filled with the current URL (this is also how you can get or edit
the current tab’s URL).</p>

<h3 id="find-or-ask-ai">§ <a href="#find-or-ask-ai"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Find or Ask AI</a></h3>
<p>Like every browser <code>CMD+F</code> opens up a search query that
highlights results found on the page. Novel to Arc is the native
integration of AI — if you type something that isn’t found on the page,
<code>Enter</code> with start an AI chat that is loaded with the current
page in context (or a truncation of it if the page is too long).</p>
<p><img src="/asset/arc-browser-review/find-ask-with-ai.png"
alt="find-ask-with-ai" /></p>
<p>A priori it might seem odd that Find and Chat are accessed the same
way, but in practice it makes so much sense. For example, if I’m reading
software documentation and I want to find something quickly without
reading all the context to understand where it is, I first start by
<code>CMD+F</code> for a keyword I am looking for, and if that’s not
found or the results are not helpful I change the query to "how to …" or
"what is …" or the appropriately phrasing that usually uses the keyword
I originally had.</p>
<p>It’s also useful to have a quick way to summarize an article you are
skimming (e.g. it was linked to by another article you were focussing
on, and this one’s just for some brief context). However, for this kind
of situation the next feature is also particularly useful.</p>
<p>It looks like Arc is planning to a lot with <span><a

how much is purely justification for saying "AI-powered" more often, but
so far so good.</p>
<h3 id="link-summaries-via-ai">§ <a href="#link-summaries-via-ai"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Link Summaries via AI</a></h3>
<p>If you hover over a link for a second (this used to require holding
<code>Shift</code>), a little box will appear nearby it with some text
generating into it. This is a formatted snippet, generated by AI, that
summarizes some key points it gathered from scraping the webpage. The
result is cached so if you hover over that link again it reuses the
previously-generated summary.</p>
<p><img src="/asset/arc-browser-review/ai-preview.png"
alt="ai-preview" /></p>
<p>I find this useful all the time for taking a quick peek at links
cited in articles that I would have otherwise probably not clicked.
However, I don’t think its often made it so I don’t have to actually
click a link that I normally would have — the summaries are really just
short bullet points so you know what the main topics of the linked
webpage are, and don’t give much idea of the specific content.</p>

not associated with a Space. If you set Arc to be your default browser,
then following a link from another application will open in Little Arc.
From Little Arc, you can quickly add the current page to a specific
Space of course.</p>
<p>I find Little Arc to be super useful — much more useful than I
expected. For example, if I follow a link from an email, a chat app, a
calendar event Zoom link, etc. it opens in its own new Little Arc window
rather than making my view jump to whatever the most recent browser
window is and adding this new unrelated link to whatever collection of
tabs I was already working with here. Especially working with fullscreen
apps, it’s so annoying to have to jump to another screen just to quickly
follow one link.</p>

picture-in-picture enabled view active in one Arc tab, then when you
leave that tab (by going to another tab or another application)
picture-in-picture starts automatically. This works with, for example,
youtube videos and google meet calls. So far I’ve found it really nice
to be able to, while in a Google Meeting, quickly start using the same
browser window as normal without having to open a new window to manage,
and have the picture-in-picture automatically take care of keeping the
meeting visible.</p>

<p>Arc provides a neat interface for defining "lite extensions" i.e.

You can also inject Javascript, but Boosts that don’t support sharing by

directly). There isn’t much available in the <span><a

<p>Additionally, it’s basically an easy way to hack your own dark mode,
custom formatting (i.e. change fonts), or ad blocker (you can delete any
html elements <em>permanently</em>) on any website. I’ve used it ad hoc
several times and it’s really amazing how simple they made it to do the
most common things which are custom dark mode and ad blocking.</p>
<p><img src="/asset/arc-browser-review/boosts.png" alt="boosts" /></p>
<p>One major limitation is that you can only have one boost per webpage,
so I can’t activate a custom Youtube theme at the same time as blocking
youtube shorts. So I have to choose the more important of the two, which
is fortunately an easy choice.</p>

workspaces taking notes and making sketches in a tab that can be
manipulated like any other tab. I actually haven’t used Arc’s built-in
version of this for anything, but Arc also integrates with Notion which
I use as my main note management tool. As a result there’s a keyboard
shortcut to make a new note in Notion and I can access a recent notion
page from a dropdown menu triggered by hovering over the Notion Favorite
tab.</p>

as integrated with the Apple ecosystem as Safari, so there are still
somethings that I go to Safari for. One particular thing this is
annoying for is passwords, since I use the Safari password manager to
generate and save passwords (auto syncs with my iPhone). Beyond that, it
doesn’t really have its mobile solution worked out either — see the next
demerit.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-apps">§ <a href="#mobile-apps"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Mobile Apps</a></h3>
<p>There are two Arc mobile apps: Arc (Sidebar) and Arc Search. - Arc
(Sidebar) syncs with your Spaces on the desktop app, but doesn’t have as
slick an interface and isn’t considered a browser by iOS for some reason
so you can’t even set it as your default browser. - Arc Search
<em>is</em> a real browser according to iOS, but it doesn’t sync with
your Spaces on the desktop app. Basically it’s a totally separate
browser instance, and a different version too since it doesn’t even have
spaces — it’s just one big space. And no basic features like bookmarks
or Pinned tabs or anything.</p>
<p>Overall, my sense is that The Browser Company just doesn’t know how
they want to do mobile yet, but they knew they needed something so they
gave us something.</p>
<p>Arc Search is pointless, almost a joke for how featureless it is. Why
is it even called "Arc" at all? Arc (Sidebar) is pretty nice, even if
it’s not fully polished, and I would set it as my default mobile browser
today — if I could. It makes no sense that it’s not a real browser
according to iOS. I’m guessing that this is some weird technical
limitation to integrating with iOS that they haven’t solved yet.</p>
<p>I’m sure they are planning to integrate Arc Search and Arc (Sidebar)
in the near future. In its current state, the mobile experience is not
worth switching browsers even though I use Arc on Mac. The only reason I
keep Arc installed at all is it allows me to "share" links to Arc from
other mobile apps, which I have Pinned to a certain space so that I can
review them later on my Mac.</p>
<h3 id="spaces-management">§ <a href="#spaces-management"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Spaces Management</a></h3>
<p>So far there doesn’t seem to have been much though put into managing
a large number of spaces. While I’ve not gone over ~8 spaces at a time,
I soon will and I’m not hopeful for the experience.</p>
<p>Currently, spaces are arranged linearly, and you have to scroll
horizontally through them. While the spaces view is ok since it does let
you see all the tabs in each Space as you scroll through them, it really
has to improve a lot in order to be useful for large collections of
spaces. If I have 100 spaces, I at least one a smaller view of each
space so I can see more than 5 spaces at a time while I’m looking for
the right one.</p>
<p>Also, it’s fairly easy to move one tab from one space to another —
this action is available in a right-click menu from the tab. But, its
painful to move several tabs from one space to another, since moving the
first tab will jump you to that space, and then you have to go back to
the original space and go through the right-click menu again, for each
tab.</p>
<p>And one more thing — I’d like to be able to make a <em>new</em> space
to add a tab from Little Arc to rather than having to add it to an
existing space. There are several times that I have a link open in
Little Arc from an email or message or something and I know it is the
start of a Space, but I have to first go to a main instance of Arc in
order to create the Space, and <em>then</em> I can come back to the
Little Arc tab and add it to the new Space.</p>

href="#weird-interactions-with-site-specific-keyboard-shortcuts"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Weird Interactions with
Site-Specific Keyboard Shortcuts</a></h3>
<p>I can see there were some difficult choices to make with keyboard
shortcuts: since Arc provides so many of them, it developed a system for
requiring you to press the keyboard shortcut <em>twice</em> in order to
confirm if that keyboard shortcut is in conflict with a keyboard
shortcut provided by a webpage. In theory this is ok, but in practice it
can be very annoying because the whole point of keyboard shortcuts is to
be able to do something quickly without thinking about it, and having to
figure out why it’s not happening and then doing something unique to any
other app can disrupt the smooth usage of a keyboard shortcut
significantly. Personally I just removed all the Arc keyboard shortcuts
except for the essentials which basically never conflict with existing
shortcuts on websites.</p>
