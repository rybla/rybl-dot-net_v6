<h1 id="contrasting-puzzle-and-strategy-games">Contrasting Puzzle and
Strategy Games</h1>
<p>What distinguishes a puzzle game from a strategy game?</p>
<p>To be clear, I have the following meanings in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>game</strong> is an interactive, isolated environment with
clearly-defined rules.</li>
<li>A <strong>puzzle</strong> game is a game with win conditions, where
the players must develop and execute the perfect strategy (i.e. the
solution to the puzzle) over a relatively few iterations in order to win
once.</li>
<li>A <strong>strategy</strong> game is an game with a win conditions,
where the players develop strategies and skills over relatively many
iterated rounds in order win more often.</li>
</ul>
<p>To slightly justify these definitions — these are useful categories
in the context of game design (I recommend reading about Keith Burgun’s
<span><a href="http://keithburgun.net/interactive-forms/"><img
src="/favicon/keithburgun.net.png" class="favicon"
alt="/favicon/keithburgun.net.png" />The Four Interactive Forms</a><span

class="preview-description">Placeholder description for
http://keithburgun.net/interactive-forms/</span></span></span> for an
in-depth basis for a categorization of games, that includes strategy
games and puzzle games). From a player’s perspective, puzzle games and
strategy games provide very different kinds of experiences that appeal
to different kinds of players. And from a designer’s perspective, what
makes a good puzzle game is very different from what makes a good
strategy game. These dynamics can be roughly summarized as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a puzzle game:
<ul>
<li>The players want to explore the game’s state space, seeking
non-obvious patterns that hint them towards the correct solution to the
puzzle.</li>
<li>The designers want to embed solutions that require interesting use
of patterns they expect the player to learn up while playing the
game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a strategy game, the players
<ul>
<li>The players want to explore the game’s strategy space, gaining
practiced skills and seeking locally-maximal strategies that compete in
an ever-changing meta-game.</li>
<li>The designers want to roughly balance the power of a variety of
interesting strategies, while also allowing for experimentation to yield
good strategies that fall outside any given meta-game.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In useful game-theoretic terminology, a player’s strategy is a map
which associates each possible game state to the game move that the
player decides they make for that game state.</p>
<p>As an example comparison, consider the puzzle game Tic-Tac-Toe and
strategy game Chess.</p>
<p>Though Tic-Tac-Toe isn’t typically called a puzzle game, it is. In
Tic-Tac-Toe, the players take turns making a game move (marking a space)
over the game state (shared board). If after a turn, one player has a
winning configuration in the state (3 of their markings in a row), they
win the game. What makes Tic-Tac-Toe a puzzle game is the fact that
there is a solution that players can find. The solution to Tic-Tac-Toe
is the strategy that guarantees the player wins or at least draws. So,
the puzzle for the players is to find this strategy. Since, for
competent players, solving this puzzle is simple enough, it doesn’t even
require another person to play it with you!</p>
<p>This is a common aspect of good puzzle games — executing the solution
to the puzzle should be trivial relative to finding the solution. The
purpose of execution at all is just to check that your solution is
correct. In the case of Tic-Tac-Toe, it might be satisfying to check
your solution by playing against another player just to make sure you
haven’t overlooked some possibility.</p>
<p>Though I mention this as an aspect of good puzzle games, Tic-Tac-Toe
is not an example of one. The big, glaring problem with Tic-Tac-Toe is
that the solution is very simple to calculate by brute-force, and it
doesn’t make any use of interesting intermediary patterns. There are no
useful “heuristics” to use in Tic-Tac-Toe, especially since its so easy
to just use the solution as a “perfect heuristic.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, now let us consider the strategy game of Chess. In
Chess, the players take turns making a game move (moving a piece
according to its particular movement rules) on the game state (shared
board). If after a turn, one player has a winning configuration in the
state (checkmate with the other player’s King piece), they win the game.
So far, this all sounds eerily similar to Tic-Tac-Toe. Then might Chess
actually be a puzzle game after all? It can be proven for Chess that
there must exist a strategy that guarantees to either the first or
second player a win or at least a draw. In other words, there does exist
a solution to the game of Chess. Yet, Chess is not a puzzle game just
because of this, which is just obvious from observing competent Chess
players. The players do not have the solution, and (currently) it is not
plausible that they could discover it. Chess, it turns out, is
sufficiently complicated enough that computing the solution strategy is
not (currently) plausible by either brute force or heuristic.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, what arises in Chess is a meta-game of
competing strategies. Since no strategy is the solution strategy, each
strategy must recognize at least one other as able to best it. Players
recognize this, and so develop heuristics for deducing what strategy
their opponent is using, what strategy will most likely beat it, and how
to conceal the weaknesses of their own strategy. As strategies compete
and evolve, the meta-game of Chess develops heuristics and abstractions
in order to be able to compare strategies in the same terms and specify
mutations of strategies. Perhaps the most clear example in Chess is the
assignment of point values to each piece. The point value assignment is
a heuristic which helps to decide how the trading of two pieces will
affect the winning chances of each player. There is nothing inherent to
the game of Chess that specifies these point values, and the
undiscovered solution to Chess need not have any reference to point
values either.</p>
<p>The critical distinction I draw between Tic-Tac-Toe and Chess that
results in them being different kinds of games is that the expected
attainability of a solution in Tic-Tac-Toe makes the game be about
seeking that solution, whereas the unattainability of a solution in
Chess makes the game be about developing competing sub-optimal
strategies. Playing Tic-Tac-Toe serves as a test to check whether or not
you have found a solution, whereas playing Chess serves as a trial by
which to judge how two strategies fare against each other.</p>
<p>The key aspect of Chess that I have been relying on in this analysis
is that the solution to Chess is (currently) unattainable i.e. it is not
plausible for players to discover it. This constraint is a computational
constraint which can be formally specified as:</p>
<p>A strategy game requires that the computational power provided to
players is insufficient to compute the solution.</p>
<p>(Note that this does not rule out general heuristics, but it does
rule out perfect heuristics which are just short-cuts to the solution
(since the deduction that a heuristic is perfect is included in the
constraint on computational power).)</p>
<p>Since without this constraint, a strategy game loses the aspects that
distinguished it from a puzzle, this implies that</p>
<p>Strategy games are puzzles where the computational power provided to
players is insufficient to compute the solution.</p>
<h1 id="solving-a-strategy-game">Solving a Strategy Game</h1>
<p>On important condition on this claim is the “computation power
provided to players” part. The computational power provided to players
could be whatever computational power they can amass whenever and for
however long the player likes, but it could also be much more
constrained than that.</p>
<p>One manifestation of this already in Chess is the use of time
constraints — a time constraint is a computational constraint, in this
case on your brain’s computation. This time constraint is useful because
there are obvious advantages to taking a longer amount of time to decide
your move; if you take more time then you can consider more possible
outcomes and make a better decision! But the game of Chess becomes
somewhat less interesting if the time constraint is removed. In the
abstract extreme, it’s rational for a player to take as much time as
they possibly can in order to do as deep of a Monte-Carlo simulation
starting from the current game state as they can since, the deeper they
go, the better the move will likely be.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is some variety of the time constraints to choose
to impose. Casual Chess might have the time constraint of a minute or so
(or until your opponent gets too annoyed or bored to continue play,
which I shall consider yielding an undefined state rather than a
perverse draw). Competitive Chess has a timer system, where each player
is allocated an amount of time at the start, and can choose how much of
that total to spend on each turn (in real time). In standard matches,
the timer is initialized with 20 minutes or so, which allows for
relatively careful consideration of how to allocate your time. In Bullet
Chess, the timer can be set much lower, to 60 seconds or even just 30
seconds! This results in a whole different kind of game, where
strategies and skill center around determining a reasonable move as
quickly as possible, with much less emphasis on achieving something
close to a local maximum. In Bullet Chess games, it is common to play
electronically where you have access to features not implementable in
the physical game, such as pre-moves, where a player can queue-up moves
to be executed in order on their next turns before the player even sees
what the opponent’s moves were.</p>
<p>In addition to time constraints, competitive Chess has constraints on
computer resources as well. For example, players are forbidden from
querying programs Chess-playing programs like StockFish in order to
inform their moves.</p>
<p>This all goes to show that computational constraints are a design
decision just like other aspects of a game. Even if, someday, such
powerful computers were build that computed the solution to Chess, Chess
could still be a fun strategy game for players that are computationally
constrained in the same way they are now. Of course, it could also turn
out that the solution to Chess is somehow easily memorizable by even
computationally-constrained humans, in which case the game would be
effectively ruined forever as it would be a bad strategy game since it
has a known and easily-executable solution and would be a bad puzzle
game since the solution is near-impossible to discover without immensely
powerful computers.</p>
