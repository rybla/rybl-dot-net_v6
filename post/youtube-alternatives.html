<p>YouTube.com was the second most popular with 34.6 billion visits.
This was 37.4% as much traffic as the first most popular website --
Google.com with 92.5 billion visits -- and 135.0% as much traffic as the
third most popular website -- Facebook.com with 20 billion visits.</p>
<p>Together, YouTube and Facebook majorly dominate the market of
(non-porn) public video hosting. The only entity that even comes close
is the fourth and fifth most popular websites -- Twitter.com with 6.6
billion visits and Instagram.com with 6.1 billion visits -- which are
19.1% and 17.6% as much traffic as just YouTube.com respectively. Of
course, Facebook.com, Twitter.com, and Instagram.com are not only
centered around video content so this comparison to YouTube.com's domain
of video hosting is only partial.</p>
<p>In the same way that Google.com has dominated search and Facebook.com
has dominated social media (debatable what "social media" means here),
YouTube has dominated public video hosting.</p>
<h1 id="youtubes-revenue-model">YouTube's Revenue Model</h1>
<p>How does YouTube make money? According to YouTube, they makes money
in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payments from advertisers in return for hosting ads on most YouTube
videos</li>
<li>Payments from subscribers to YouTube Premium in return to access to
exclusive content funded by YouTube</li>

<p>The vast majority of YouTube's revenue comes from advertising
[citation needed].</p>
<h1 id="youtubes-network-effects">YouTube's Network Effects</h1>
<p>Independent video creators (or just "creators" for short) create the
vast majority of content of YouTube. Even the YouTube Premium content is
usually made by creators that started out like anyone else and built an
audience over years of producing publically-available videos on
YouTube.</p>
<p>In order for YouTube to be such a popular site, it needs to have a
large amount and variety of content that appeal strongly to many
different kinds of users. With such a huge creator base producing
content, YouTube clearly meets this demand. The network effect here is
that new creators that are considering where to publish their content
are more attracted to YouTube the more users are there to watch their
content, and new users that are considering where to look for content
are more attracted to YouTube the more creators publish their content
there. This virtuous cycle results in YouTube gaining a massive
advantage over competitors, as any small starting differential in users
and creators between YouTube and competitors in the past grows much
larger over time as the advantage accumulates due to the increasing
returns (as opposed to diminishing return) aspect of network effects
with respect to gaining new users and creators.</p>
<p>How could a new competitor possibly compete with YouTube with this
dynamic persisting?</p>
<h1 id="competing-with-youtube">Competing with YouTube</h1>
<p>To decide a measure for competativeness with YouTube, first specify
respects to which the competitor would like to compete with YouTube.
This could be all respects where the competitor is better in every way,
or a selection of respects where the competitor does not compete for all
of YouTube's market but can still gain an advantage in a submarket.</p>
<p>Some example respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attractiveness for creators</li>
<li>Quality content</li>
<li>Curated content</li>
<li>Personalized/commissioned content</li>
<li>TODO: more respects</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these are already approved upon from YouTube by websites such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Vimeo</em>, etc. allows a creator to put their videos on sale
for a chosen prices so that users can directly buy access to individual
videos.</li>
<li><em>Patreon</em>, etc. simplfies the process of a creator receiving
support directly from fans, and allows a creator to gather a
personalized community and sell commisioned content to patrons.</li>
<li><em>Netflix</em>, <em>Hulu</em>, etc. offer quality, curated,
long-form content (movies and TV shows) for a fixed subscription price
with (usually) no advertisements.</li>
<li><em>Twitch</em>, etc. offer specialized livestreaming services and
audience interaction.</li>
<li>TODO: more examples</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, there still is some diverse competition among specific
sub-markets of public video hosting, even if YouTube dominates the most
generic case and, even combined altogether these submarkets probably do
not match half of YouTube's popularity (by average views).</p>
<p>So, is there some clear inefficiency in this state of affairs where a
new competitor <em>should</em> be able to compete with YouTube more
directly? Or are there good reasons why competition should focus on
these more niche markets rather than try to compete for YouTube's
creators and users in general?</p>
<h1 id="youtubes-general-advantage">YouTube's General Advantage</h1>
<p>A major respect to which no public video hosting service seems to
compete well with YouTube on is sheer scale. As of February 2020,
YouTube announced that about 720 thousand hours of video are uploaded to
and 1 billion hours of video are watched on YouTube each day. [<span><a

<p>Video is the highest-bandwidth media popularly consumed: they are
very large (being a long collection of images) and are consumed fast.
Hosts and browsers have even adopted special support for
<em>buffering</em> specifically to allow viewing to be possible in HTML.
To facilitate such high-bandwidth hosting at such a large scale, a
provider needs to have very distributed (for robustness and mitigating
latency) and powerful infrastructure.</p>

thought that YouTube might not have a sustainable business model

When Google bought YouTube, it kickstarted its popularity by expanding
this infrastructure in order to increase capacity, which ultimately
facilitated the increasing returns of network effects that played such a
large part in building YouTube's dominance today. Without access to
Google's capital, YouTube the start-up might not have been able to
afford or judge worthwhile the risk of investing in the infrastructure
that was so important for its success.</p>
<p>Today, the activation costs are higher and lower in different
ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The costs of hosting content online is much lower due to better
access to third-party, business-oriented content hosting services.
However, these services are more costly on margin than owning the
infrastructure yourself, so in the long-run take a deep cut into overall
profits.</li>
<li>With YouTube as an existing and hugely dominant market player, a new
competitor needs to overcome YouTube's advantages. Since YouTube is
basically free for users and creators, it is diffuclt to undercut its
prices (although, they can still be undercut by paying more to creators
and even users). A competitor would need to appeal to a submarket, as
mentioned in the Competing with YouTube section earlier.</li>
<li>It is much easier for new competition to get noticed on today's
internet as opposed to the internet of 2006 when there were many fewer
users and much worse ability to share links to content. Online
advertisement is easier and more efficient than ever.</li>
<li>TODO: more ways</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="predictions">Predictions</h1>
<p>In the next 10 years, I expect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Activation costs for undercutting YouTube with a generally better
service are too high and have too low expected returns to expect it to
be accomplished successfully anytime soon. YouTube will maintain a huge
dominance in general public video hosting, but its dominant share of
traffic will be roughly stable.</p></li>
<li><p>The submarkets of public video hosting will become more
prominent, and start to eat away at YouTube's user/creator base. YouTube
will still be the home for random homemade content and newly independent
creators, but a variety of other platforms will attract away creators
with features cater to their specific kinds content. Creators can will
make their start on YouTube, but usually migrate to other platforms once
they find a content niche. This will be facilitated by a drop in the
effective cost of using alternative platforms due to an homogenizing of
user interfaces and sharing methods.</p></li>
