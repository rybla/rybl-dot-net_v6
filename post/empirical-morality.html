<h1 id="moral-theories-and-metaethics">Moral Theories and
Metaethics</h1>
<p>A <em>moral claim</em> is a true judgment of the morality of an
action i.e. whether or not an action <em>ought</em> to be taken. An
<em>ethical theory</em> is a theory that explains how moral claims are
true (i.e. justifications for moral claims). A meta ethical theory (or
<em>theory of morality</em>) is a theory of which justifications for
moral claims are valid (i.e. explanations for the basis of morality).
For example, <em>utilitarianism</em> is an ethical theory — it gives a
framework for calculating which actions are moral. But utilitarianism is
not a metaethical theory since it does not explain why the calculations
correctly map onto morality. Nihilism is a metaethical theory since it
is about which justifications for moral claims are valid, in particular,
that there are no valid justifications.</p>
<p>This essay focuses on the metaethical side of the topic of morality,
and I will present a metaethical theory: Moral Empiricism.</p>
<p>To lead up to the metaethical questions, first consider what sorts of
moral claims there are. At first glance, there are three kinds of moral
claims to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>moral claims that are justified by some moral claims</li>
<li>moral claims that are justified by only non-moral claims</li>
<li>moral claims that need no justification</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this classification is epistemic, <em>not</em> metaphysical
(This is because it uses “justified because of” as opposed to “true
because of”. I am avoiding the metaphysics of <span><a

alt="/favicon/stanford.edu.ico" />https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truthmakers/</a></em></span><span
class="preview-description">Placeholder description for
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truthmakers/</span></span></span>).
In this way, the classification of moral claims into type 1 or type 2
depends on which ethical theory is used as a premise, whereas a
metaphysical classification would not. For example, the truth that
murder is wrong is a type 1 moral claim under the premise of Judaism
(via the 10 commandments), but it is a type 2 moral claim under a
utilitarianism (via a utility calculation).</p>
<p>A type 1 moral claims are the most common in everyday life. It's
morally wrong to hurt people and steal things because, for example,
hurting people causes people to experience suffering (which is morally
wrong) and stealing things causes innocent people to be worse off (which
is morally wrong). Most of the time, these sorts of justifications are
plenty, because it’s obvious, for some reasons, that, for example,
causing people to experience suffering is morally wrong.</p>
<p>A type 2 moral claim appeals to some non-moral domain of truth for
justification. For example, the moral claim that murder is wrong could
be justified by the fact that murder is against the 10 commandments.
This justification appeals to premise that the 10 commandments
accurately reflect morality, which is a non-moral premise.</p>
<p>Note that religious justifications aren't the only ones that fall
under type 2. As another example, utilitarianism is a moral framework
where the morality of an action is judged by its expected utility yield.
A utilitarian could justify the moral claim that murder is wrong by
saying that murder reduces expected utility. This justification appeals
to the premise that utilitarianism is true, which is a non-moral
premise.</p>
<p>A type 3 moral claim does no make any appeal at all to a
justification (moral or otherwise ) -- it is an axiomatic truth. For
example, a non-religious person could believe in all the same moral
claims as a religious person, but the non-religious person could differ
from the religious person by positing the moral claims that were
justified by religion as axioms instead. Trivial moral claims (such as
“A is moral because A is moral”) that are true in any ethical theory are
all type 3 moral claims. But it seems that non-trivial type 3 moral
claims are normal inaccessible, since if they have no justification then
how could anyone be convinced of a type 3 moral claim if they did not
already know it to be true?</p>
<p>In order to figure the <em>foundations</em> for moral claims, it is
sufficient to consider only type 2 and 3 moral claims; a chain of type 1
moral claims must eventually appeal to a type 2 or 3 moral claim or else
the moral framework is inconsistent because it contains justification
cycles or infinite justification chains.</p>
<p>Next, how many type 2 and type 3 moral claims are there? There is of
course the entire class of trivial moral claims that are true in any
ethical theory. But, for any ethical theory that yields more than
trivial moral claims, it must also yield some type 2 moral claims.</p>
<p>Type 2 truths are a good place to consider some curious metaethical
aspects of ethical theories. For the example of murder being wrong in
utilitarianism, the chain of justification usually goes something like
this:</p>
<p>Murder is wrong because:</p>
<ol>
<li>A murder produces X net utility (by calculation)</li>
<li>X is negative (by inspection)</li>
<li>A murder is an action that produces negative net utility (by 1,
2)</li>
<li>An action that produces negative net utility is morally wrong
because:
<ol>
<li>Utilitarianism is true (because of course)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Murder is morally wrong (by 3, 4)</li>
</ol>
<p>In this chain, 4 is a type 2 moral claim, and 4.1 is a metaethical
claim.</p>
<p>The key maneuver here is the claim that utilitarianism is true. Since
this is a metaethical claim, it must be justified become introducing
moral grounds for justification — it would be a vicious regress to claim
that utilitarianism is true by appealing to another ethical theory,
since now that (second order) ethical theory would now need the same
sort of justification. Regardless, this is usually how that point 4.1
would be justified:</p>
<p>Utilitarianism is true because:</p>
<ul>
<li>What, you’d prefer if there was more suffering rather than less!?
It’s utilitarianism is clearly the most moral system, and you would be
immoral to appose it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, replace “utilitarianism” with your most favored/hated ethical
theory.</p>
<h1 id="metaethical-justifications-for-ethical-theories">Metaethical
Justifications for Ethical Theories</h1>
<h2 id="moral-intuitionism">Moral Intuitionism</h2>
<p>One popular way to approach metaethical justification is to rely
heavily on type 3 moral claims. In particular, a particular ethical
theory is justified by how exactly it includes a pre-determined set of
type 3 moral claims that are <em>just true</em>. For example, if we all
<em>just know</em> that murder is wrong, then any ethical theory that
says murder is morally good is weekend and any ethical theory that says
murder is morally bad is strengthened in terms of metaethical
justification.</p>
<p>This style of metaethical justification is <em>moral
intuitionism</em> which states that an ethical theory is justified by
how exactly is complies with type 3 moral claims that we <em>just
know</em> to be true (i.e. our moral intuitions).</p>
<p>As (implicitly) popular as it is, moral intuitionism has some steep
drawbacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>It appears that there are many moral intuitions that are not
universally shared. So, a moral relativist must choose one:
<ul>
<li>Accept <em>moral relativism</em>: moral truths are subjective (as
opposed to objective), so different people can correctly believe in
contradictory moral truths.</li>
<li>Reject moral relativism, which requires an account for how and why
there is something inferior about the intuitions of those that do not
share the true moral intuitions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The correspondence between moral intuitions and moral truths is not
obvious. In fact, there are plenty of cases where the same person’s
moral intuitions are internally inconsistent (especially over time). So,
in order to disallow inconsistent ethical theories, a moral intuitionist
must account for which intuitions do and don’t correspond to moral
truths and why.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accepting-moral-relativism">Accepting Moral Relativism</h3>
<p>The simplest response to these drawbacks is to accept moral
relativism, but this has two very steep drawbacks. To accept moral
relativism is to claim that all moral claims are subjective i.e. are
implicitly prefixed with “for me, …” The issue with this is that, when
people actually do make moral claims, the claims are not very sensical
with implicit subjectivity. For example, typically when a person claims
“murder is wrong,” they are not claiming that it is wrong just for
<em>them</em> to murder, but that it is wrong for <em>anyone</em> to
murder. Additionally, they are not claiming murder is wrong from their
own perspective (though that is also true), but that murder is wrong
from any perspective. To figure (with these clarifications) that they
still mean their claim subjectively seems to be some sort of
misunderstanding. So the first steep drawback of moral relativism is to
accept this, which implies that the vast majority of moral claims are
either false (since objective moral claims are false) or fundamentally
misunderstood by their speakers (they think they are making an objective
claim, but they are actually making a subjective one). Under this, a
moral relativist must reject basically everything currently established
about morality, yielding just that each person has their own correct,
personal, and entirely unique ethical theory judged by their
intuitions.</p>
<p>The second steep drawback of moral relativism is that it contradicts
the usual meaning of morality itself. It is generally accepted for
people to have contradicting yet subjectively-true beliefs (e.g.
opinions about subjective preferences). But it seems almost nonsensical
to say that there can be contradictory yet true claims about what
<em>ought</em> to be done. For example, suppose that person P1 believes
that action A ought to be done and person P2 believes that action A
ought to not be done. The subjective truths are that A ought to be done
(from P1’s point of view) and A ought not to be done (from P2’s point of
view). These are not contradictory, because of the different points of
view. The moral relativist claims that the moral conversation stops
here, as there is no way to settle this difference — there is no such
thing as an objective point of view by which to view moral truths, even
though (in an objective reality) only A or not A can actually be
done.</p>
<p>// TODO: really get into why moral relativism is objectionable, and
justify meta*ethical justifications here.</p>
<h2 id="hierarchies-of-moral-intuitions">Hierarchies of Moral
Intuitions</h2>
<p>If a moral intuitionist rejects moral relativism (i.e. they maintain
that there are objective moral truths) then they must account for how to
decide which moral intuition are (most likely to be) correct and why. In
this direction, presenting a decision process is easy, but justifying it
is very difficult.</p>
<p>// TODO: use this? For example, a moral intuitionist could say that
those intuitions that are had in calm, low-pressure circumstances with
lots of time to deliberate with other people are the most likely to be
correct. This seems reasonable enough, since we can all relate to the
how panicked, high-pressure circumstances can often lead to regrettable
choices on any topic.</p>
<p>Here a moral intuitionist can make a metaphysical distinction that
hasn’t been specified yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moral intuitions are <em>the basis</em> on which ethical theories
are justified. In this case, there is something metaphysically special
about moral intuitions. So there needs to be no justification for a
choice of which moral intuitions are true, since the true moral
intuitions simply are the definitional basis of metaethical
justification. This an unpopular position, and devolves into arguing
about the definitional foundations of morality and metaethical
justification, so it seems like a dead end.</li>
<li>Moral intuitions are <em>indicators</em> of which ethical theories
are justified. In this case, moral intuitions are playing a merely
epistemic role, helping people have knowledge of moral truths (in some
way). So, it is easy for the moral intuitionist to explain how the
circumstances for intuitions that we trust the most in general about
subjects that we can objectively verify (such as logical and many
physical facts) can also be reasonably trusted the most also for moral
intuitions for the same reasons. However, an account of how moral
intuitions given any knowledge at all about moral truths is still
difficult — how do we <em>know</em> that moral intuitions are such
indicators? This also seems like a fairly dead end, with the only escape
being a vicious regress of appealing to higher-level intuitions that
lower-level intuitions are indicators of the truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So altogether, the variety of branches that moral intuitionism
provides all seem to end in weak positions.</p>
<h1 id="moral-constructivism">Moral Constructivism</h1>
<p>A tac that is more successful and much more popular than moral
intuitionism is <em>moral constructivism</em>, which is the claim that
moral truths are socially constructed and so don’t have intrinsic
truthfulness. In this way, moral truths are not facts about humans in
general or the physical world, but merely facts about the social
organizations of particular humans (and perhaps other things).</p>
<p>Moral constructivism solves a lot of metaethical problems, since it
gives an entire account for how ethical theories are justified, and,
even better, corresponds plausibly to how ethical theories actually are
justified. A moral constructivist says that a society negotiates a
ethical theory, through explicit exchanges, implicit norms, etc., and at
any given point there is a fact of the matter about how that society has
organized itself in order to specify a moral theory.</p>
<p>This sounds an awful lot like moral subjectivism, but it differs very
importantly. Rather than moral truths being subjective <em>to each
person</em> via on their personal moral takes, moral constructivism
appeals to an entire society’s negotiated moral stance, which is
something that can be and is agreed upon by many people (especially in
that society).</p>
<p>However, some of the problems of moral subjectivism still do leak
through to some extent, where an individual’s subjective ethical theory
is replaced by an individual society’s ethical theory. There is still
the problem of contradicting the usual meaning of morality itself: two
different societies can have clashing ethical theories that are
irreconcilable, and circumstances can arise where following both ethical
theories is impossible. For many societal/cultural features, this is not
a huge surprise or problem. Of course there are societal differences in
how people do things which seem weird when viewed from another society.
But when it comes to morality, the force of “ought” is impossible to
escape. If a society morally condones doing something that another
society finds morally wrong, then there can be a moral obligation for
conflict, as each society views their ethical theory as of course
developed within their own society but still applicable everywhere. A
moral constructivist maintains that we can as a society make moral
judgements, but admits that to check to see if the moral judgements are
correct is to do nothing more than check if they follow morality
according to the norms and customs accepted by the society.</p>
<p>And this does not just apply to co-existent societies with
contradiction moral theories. Most people accept that there has been
moral progress over at least the last couple thousand years: today more
people have more freedom and better lives than the people did in earlier
times. Yet, for the moral constructivist, this idea of moral progress is
something that only applies to the present, since the societies of the
past would probably not view present society as being more moral (and
many would view it as being much less moral). Never along the arc of
“moral progress” does a moral constructivist see a change from a “worse”
ethical theory to a “better” ethical theory, except from the point of
view of our modern constructed ethical theory by which we judge the
past.</p>
<p>This appears to contradict what most people agree on about the claim
of moral progress and what has happened over threat theme period.
Usually the claim of moral progress also include the claim that people
in the past we wrong about certain aspects of morality and right about
others. But to the moral constructivist, those people were not wrong
about morality at the time, since morality <em>was</em> just their
socially constructed system of moral rules also at the time. E.g.
There’s nothing morally wrong with slavery <em>at the time</em> and in
the places where is was accepted. Only looking back do we say that
slavery <em>is wrong now</em> according to our modern society’s ethical
theory.</p>
<h1 id="moral-empiricism">Moral Empiricism</h1>
<p><em>Moral empiricism</em> is the view that the fact of which ethical
theory is correct is merely an <em>empirical</em> fact about <em>human
nature</em>.</p>
<p>Moral empiricism is similar to moral relativism in that it admits
there is no ethical theory that is correct in an extra-human objective
way. But it avoids many typical problems of moral relativism because it
does not admit inconsistent ethical theories among humans which is
(usually) the relevant group.</p>
<p>Moral empiricism is similar to moral constructivism in that it finds
the source of morality to be human-centric as opposed to the universe in
general without specific reference to humans. But is refines the
constructed source of moraltiy to be in human nature rather than in more
superficial societal features such as political authority, trends in
moral sensibilities, etc.</p>
<p>Moral empiricism does not reduce to moral intuitionism, since
intuitions are merely a symptom of human nature. Moral intuitions are
not a part of human nature, but are caused by aspects of humans that are
accounted for by the pattern of human nature. In this way, there can by
certain statistical correlations between moral intuitions and the
correct ethical theory as sought by empirically investigating human
nature, since the influences of human nature can be invariant while
other extra-human influences vary.</p>
<p>// TODO: Give a more specific idea of what is included in the pattern
"human nature" e.g. biological patterns over time, social patters over
time, etc.</p>
<p>// TODO: Explain why moral empiricism is compelling. Not only does it
solve all these issues, but empirically it should be shown to be most
closely in line with what people mean by "morality"</p>
<p>// TODO: more explanation of moral empiricism, and give examples and
compare/contrast with other (similar) metaethical theories</p>
<p>// TODO: give interesting caveat about how moral empiricism allows
for different ethical theories to be true for pre-humans, post-humans,
and also aliens</p>
<p>// TODO: address problem of animals: actually, this is not so hard.
We feel negligible moral sympathy for animal cruelty by other animals
than we do for animal cruelty by humans, so its really about human
morality still</p>
