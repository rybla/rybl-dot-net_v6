<p><u>Abstract</u></p>
<p>Dominant assurance contracts are an interesting solution to many
collective action problems. A DAC asks an agent to pledge a donation
towards a collective action to be paid if any only if enough other
agents also pledge, and promises to pay the agent if not enough other
agents pledge. Such a contract can yield opting-in as a dominant
strategy even when an agent expects other agents not to opt-in;
free-rider incentives are removed by the assurance that no one benefits
if any agent opts-out, and payment incentivizes pessimistic agents to
opt-in anyway.</p>

Public Goods</h1>
<p>TODO</p>
<h1 id="the-two-sides-of-prisoners-dillemas">The Two Sides of Prisoners'
Dillemas</h1>
<p>Let's consider the town of Perindale. There is a proposal to
construct a public garden in downtown Perindale, and the mayor is
planning on how to faciliate this. The mayor has two important
restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>the mayor cannot <em>exclude</em> anyone from enjoying the garden
(it's supposed to be in a public garden, after all)</li>
<li>the mayor cannot <em>force</em> anyone to help construct to
garden</li>
<li>the mayor must ask the same donation amount from each resident</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how can the mayor best recruit people to construct the
garden?</p>
<p>Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, let us assume the following
(which can be relaxed later):</p>
<ul>
<li>There are \( n \) residents of Perindale.</li>
<li>Each resident gains \( X \) utility from the garden being
constructed</li>
<li>All the residents are the same with respect to factors influencing
the funding and construction of the garden</li>
<li>Constructing the garden costs \( C \) utility.</li>
<li>The garden cannot be constructed partially; if not turned into a
garden, the lot will be bought by an out-of-town euntrepenuer and turned
into a private helicopter landing pad, from which residents get \( 0 \)
utility.</li>
<li>Each resident acts perfectly rationally (i.e. maximizes expected
utility based on their beliefs).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proposal-1-simple-donations">Proposal 1: Simple Donations</h2>
<p>The first idea that comes to the mayor's mind is to simply ask
Perindale residents to donate \( D \) utility each, where \( D \leq C/(n
- 1) \) i.e. the garden would still be constructed if one resident
decided not to contribute (we shall consider the case \( D = C/(n-1) \)
in the next section). Additionally, \(( D &lt; X \)) i.e. each
resident's donation would be smaller than the amount they value the
garden.</p>
<p>Since each resident gains \( X \) utility from a constructed garden
and is being asked to donate \( D \) utility, each resident is in the
same position with respect to deciding what to do. So, the mayor asks an
aribtrary resident, Jo, how they would decide, and then generalizes this
result to all residents.</p>
<p>Jo will decide what to do based on their beliefs about the outcome
given everyone's actions. Since all the residents are the same, Jo can
expect one of two situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every other resident donates</li>
<li>Every other resident refrains</li>
</ol>
<p>The table below shows the utility payoffs to Jo and the other
residents given Jo's desicion (leftmost column) and the other residents'
desicion (topmost row).</p>
<p>| <strong>Jo, others</strong> | <strong>others donate</strong> |
<strong>others refrain</strong> | | <strong>donate</strong> | \( X - D,
(n-1) (X - D) \) | \( -D, 0 \) | | <strong>refrain</strong> | \( X ,
(n-1) (X - D) \) | \( 0, 0 \) |</p>
<p>Then, Jo decides as follows, there are two cases for what Jo believes
and so how they will decide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suppose that Jo believes that every other resident will donate. Then
Jo decides not to donate since \( X \geq X - D \) i.e. Jo still recieves
the utility of the constructed garden without having to pay. Here, Jo is
a <em>free rider</em>.</li>
<li>Suppose that Jo believes that every other resident will refrain.
Then Jo decides not to donate since \( 0 \geq -D \) their donation will
only go towards a partial garden that is worth \( 0 \) utility.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mayor realies the tragic situation (more specifically,
<em>prisoner's dillemma</em>): in either case, Jo decides not to
contribute. And since Jo is an arbitrary resident, this implies that
every resident acts like Jo, and thus no resident contributes. The
garden will not be constructed by this simple donations proposal.</p>
<p>Altogether for this proposal: refraining is a <strong>dominant
strategy</strong> since there is always an incentive to refrain.</p>
<p>As shown in Jo's reasoning, there are two sides to this tragedy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jo is able to free-ride when the other residents donate</li>
<li>Jo won't donate when they know the garden won't be constructed
anyway</li>
</ol>
<p>The following proposals 2 and 3 will cumulatively remove these
malincentives: assurance contracts prevent free-riders, and dominant
assurance contracts additionally incentivizes pessimistic residents to
still donate.</p>
<p>The mayor thanks Jo, and returns to their office to think up the new
proposals.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-2-assurance-contracts">Proposal 2: Assurance
Contracts</h2>
<p>To tackle the free-rider problem, the mayor needs to write up a
contract that removes the incentive for Jo to not contribute if Jo
believes that the other residents will contribute. Additionally, the
mayor wants to avoid wasting resources. So, they write up the following
<strong>assurance contract</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I promise to donate \( D \) utility if and only if every other
resident also signs this contract. Otherwise, I refraine from
donating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mayor consults Jo again, asking what they would do with this
proposal. Jo has the same two possible situations to expect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every other resident promises (signs the contract)</li>
<li>Every other resident refrains</li>
</ol>
<p>The table below shows the new utility payoffs to Jo and the other
residents' desicions.</p>
<p>| <strong>Jo, others</strong> | <strong>others promise</strong> |
<strong>others refrain</strong> | | <strong>promise</strong> | \( X - D,
(n - 1) (X - D) \) | \( 0, 0 \) | | <strong>refrain</strong> | \( 0 , 0
\) | \( 0, 0 \) |</p>
<p>Then, Jo decides how to act based on their belief:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suppose that Jo believes that every other resident will promise.
Then Jo decides to donate since \( X - D \geq 0 \) i.e. Jo prefers to
donate and then enjoy the garden over getting nothing.</li>
<li>Suppose that Jo believes that every other resident will refrain.
Then Jo is indifferent between donating and refraining since both given
them a payoff of \( 0 \).</li>
</ol>
<p>The mayor has made some progress! There will never be free riders
since it is strictly better to donate than refrain when Jo believes that
others will donate. Additionally, Jo is not disincentivized from
donating when other refrain. However, Jo is only indifferent here i.e.
Jo is not strictly better off when they donate rather than refrain.</p>
<p>Altogether for this proposal: promising is a <strong>weakly dominant
strategy</strong> since there is never a disincentive from
promising.</p>
<p>The mayor still hopes to do better. Not wasting utility was a good
move, but even one pessimistic believer in the whole town results in no
garden. In fact, if even one resident forgets to sign the contract then
there will be no garden! That is where the weakness in "weakly dominant
strategy" comes in. The mayor thanks Jo again and returns to their
office for, hopefully, a final draft.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-3-dominant-assurance-contracts">Proposal 3: Dominant
Assurance Contracts</h2>
<p>Ideally, the mayor wishes that each resident always be actively
incentivized to donate, not just indifferent about it, and even if they
are pessimistic about the others. In other words, that donating is a
dominant strategy. The mayor thinks for a while, and finally writes the
following contract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I promise to donate \( D \) utility if and only if every other
resident also signs this contract. Otherwise, I donate \( 0 \) and the
mayor pays me \( F \) utility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where \( D \leq C/n \) i.e. the garden is still constructed if just
one resident decides not to sign.</p>
<p>The mayor reflects on the contract, it does feel a little risky. If
enough of the residents decide not to sign, then the mayor will be
losing money by having to pay out to those that did sign, and still no
garden will be constructed. Nevertheless, the mayor has a hunch that the
details work out in everyone's favor in the end.</p>
<p>The mayor finds Jo and presents the new contract. Jo follows the same
method of consideration from earlier, where the table below shows the
new utility payoffs.</p>
<p>| <strong>Jo, others</strong> | <strong>others promise</strong> |
<strong>others refrain</strong> | | <strong>promise</strong> | \( X - D,
(n - 1) (X - D) \) | \( F, 0 \) | | <strong>refrain</strong> | \( 0 , 0
\) | \( 0, 0 \) |</p>
<p>Jo considers the new circumstances, and explains his updated
belief-dependent desicions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suppose that Jo believes that every other resident will promise.
Then Jo decides to donate since \( X - D &gt; 0 \) i.e. Jo prefers to
donate and then enjoy the garden over getting nothing.</li>
<li>Suppose that Jo believes that every other resident will refrain.
Then Jo decides to donate since \( F &gt; 0 \) i.e. Jo opts in to be
paid by the mayor since the garden isn't going to be constructed
anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>"Aha!" the mayor exclaims. Jo concedes that this proposed contract,
no matter their beliefs, yields a situation where Jo is always
incentivized to sign. Since every other resident will also follow this
logic, this implies that every resident will sign! And so the garden is
garunteed to be fully funded.</p>
<p>Even though the mayor had to include a clause about paying \( F \) to
signers when there aren't enough signers, the mayor can expect this
situation never to arise as long as the residents of Perindale are true
to their perfect rationality.</p>

<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p>Some simple definitions and explanations of the formal terms used
relating to public goods and collective action.</p>
<h2 id="goods">Goods</h2>
<p>A <strong>non-excludible good</strong> is a good that cannot have its
enjoyment limited to specific consumers. <em>Examples:</em> national
armies, outdoor air, TODO.</p>
<p>A <strong>non-rivalrous good</strong> is a good for which its
enjoyment by some consumers does not decrease the amount it can be
enjoyed by other consumers. <em>Examples:</em> intellectual property,
blogs, national armies, street lights.</p>
<p>A <strong>public good</strong> is a good that is
<strong>non-excludible</strong> and <strong>non-rivalrous</strong>.
<em>Examples:</em> national armies, ideas, outdoor air, vistas, public
parks,</p>
<p>A <strong>free rider problem</strong> is a collective action problem
of funding a <strong>public good</strong> when agents have the ability
to opt-out of paying and still enjoy the good. A <strong>free
rider</strong> is an agent that decides not to pay towards funding the
public good, yet still enjoys the public good to the same extent as
other agents that did decide to pay. <em>Examples:</em> funding many
public services like parks, armies, etc.</p>
<h2 id="collective-action-problems">Collective Action Problems</h2>
<p>A <strong>collective action problem</strong> is a problem of
coordinating agents to cooperate when there are incentives for each
agent to defect, and if too many agents defect then every agent is worst
off. Three popular classes of collective action problems are
<strong>free rider problems</strong>, <strong>tragedies of the
commons</strong>, and <strong>prisoners' dillemas</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>tragedy of the commons</strong> is a collective action
problem of rationing a public good that, while non-rivalrous at
reasonable levels of use, becomes rivalrous over a certain volume of
use. The <strong>tragedy</strong> is that each agent has an incentive to
use the public good a reasonable amount on their own, but too many
agents deciding to do so overuse the good. <em>Examples:</em> rationing
use of public parks, lakes, air quality.</p>
<p>A <strong>prisoners' dillema</strong> is a collective action problem
where cooperating agents are well off, defecting agents are the best off
when there are enough other cooperating agents, if too many agents
defect then all agents are the worst off, and no communication between
agents is allowed. (Note that a free rider problem without communication
is a prisoner' dillema.) The name is inspired by the following
story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two prisoners, A and B, are on trial for a bank robbery they comitted
as partners. They are put into seperate rooms and each offered the same
options: (cooperate) recieve the standard sentence of 2 years, or
(defect) reveal evidence incriminating your partner to increase their
sentence by 3 years, and decrease your sentence by 1 year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each scenario, the sentences (in years) are arranged below. The
entry "x, y" represents that prisoner A gets a sentnce</p>
<p>| <strong>A , B</strong> | <strong>cooperate</strong> |
<strong>defect</strong> | | <strong>cooperate</strong> | 2 , 2 | 5 , 1 |
| <strong>defect</strong> | 1 , 5 | 4 , 4 |</p>
<p>The prisoners have no opportunity to communicate before making their
desicions, since they are in separate cells. From the table above, it is
clear that the prisoners are best off in total if they both cooperate:
they recieve sentencings of 4 years totaled between then.</p>
<p>Yet, consider the ways that each prisoner considers their partner. If
one knows that the other will cooperate, then it is best for one to
defect and recieve 1 year instead of 2. Alternative, if one knows that
the other will defect, then it is best for one to defect and recieve 4
years instead of 5. So, it is inevitable that, whatever either prisoner
believes of the other, the best option for each is to defect. This is a
problem because even though there exists the best option overall to both
cooperate, perfectly-rational prisoners will never obtain it.</p>
<h2 id="assurance-contracts">Assurance Contracts</h2>
<p>An <strong>assurance contract</strong> is a contract between a
population of agents where each agent pledges to contribute towards an
action if at least a certain amount is pledged in total. Examples:
