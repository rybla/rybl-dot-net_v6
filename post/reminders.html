<p>A short story.</p>
</div>
<p>This morning I awoke from a restless sleep into chilling
circumstances which I am still coming to understand. I had never been to
this strange room in this barren apartment. When I first awoke, I
thought that perhaps I had been brought to a friend’s place after a
night of heavy drinking, but that hope was short-lived. I began to truly
panic when I found a eerie sticky note pasted to the wall next to my
bed. It was red and scribbled with yellow ink that read:</p>
<p>"They seem to have mind-controlling capabilities. You've been brought
here by force. Only trust notes written with yellow on red like this
one. Do not trust anyone or anything else.”</p>
<p>I am still not sure where that note came from. Was this notice meant
for someone else? Who else would be expected in the apartment? Was I not
meant to be there. I tried to calm myself into thinking it must be some
sort of joke, but it turns out that theory is certainly incorrect.</p>
<p>In the room there was a dresser, a closet, and a desk covered in
papers. The dresser contained two pairs of black pants, one pair of
jeans, two white undershirts, eight pairs of multicolored briefs, and
seven pairs of white socks. The closet contained one black suit, two
brown jackets, and two long white lab coats. I dressed and quickly
checked the apartment, as it turned out to be. I was being kept here
alone, and the front door was only locked from inside. So I sat down to
scour the papers.</p>
<p>Most of the papers were prints of academic research about clinical
trials being conducted on some new “arthritis pharmaceutical
treatments.” I have not uncovered the true purpose of these experiments
yet. I have found that I have some implicit expertise in understanding
the jargon, although I have no recollection other than vague memories of
attending physiology classes in undergraduate, which couldn’t possible
account entirely. I am something like 40-45 years old now.</p>
<p>One stapled bundle of hand-written pages stood out. It had a red
sticky note attached to its top right corned, and a yellow message on it
said “trust me.” The pages described a day in the life of someone who
wrote both in a style and about a situation eerily similar to mine —
someone who called themselves “Bruce.” Many parts of it are clearly
manipulative, so either Bruce is one of 'them,' or he is really trying
to help me but his writing was modified.</p>
<p>Bruce described how he awoke in an apartment very similar to this
one, except that there were many more articles of clothing in the
dresser and several pieces of furniture that I had not found in my
apartment. He had found a note on the desk describing a strange memory
loss, encounters with remnants of Neil (what the previous occupant of
the apartment called themselves) a brief synopsis of Neil’s activities
that day, and finally instructions for how Neil thought he should
properly conduct himself at work from then on. Bruce found this note
strange since it was written in a handwriting and phrasing similar to
his, but certainly not written by him because Neil’s mindset and
behaviors were so foreign. Bruce mused that he did not recognize the
name "Neil," but maybe these were notes from a coworker that he had
accidentally taken home with him.</p>
<p>The next pages described how Bruce dressed in work attire, found a
key in a backpack, and then drove a car from out front that the key fit
to the workplace described in the notes in order to see if he could
gather more information there. Most of the employees there recognized
Bruce, but they all called him by a different name — Aaron — and
couldn’t give any specific details about his personal life or recent
past. Bruce presented this observation with high suspicion.</p>
<p>Eventually he found a group of scientists that claimed to be his
coworkers, and from whom he learned where to find his apparent boss. His
boss called him Jeremy, and explained that he had just been hired the
previous week as an experienced pharmaceutical chemist mainly to oversee
the production of some new drugs being tested in the arthritis treatment
trials. Bruce reflected on how he played it cool but wasn’t sure if he
had aroused significant suspicion. However, he further retrospected,
that worry would be in vain.</p>
<p>The next few pages summarized how Bruce went to work, following his
coworkers, doing what he deduced his duties were based on the records of
what was said to be his previous duties. Everyone seemed happy his
performance, but he caught some personel giving him weird looks while
talking behind his back. Bruce noted their names and appearances but was
unable to recall anything in particular they said. Later in the day,
Bruce discovered that he had a desk in a shared office. The desk
superficially had nothing of interest other than a few scattered
academic prints, which he stashed in his backpack.</p>
<p>The last page was a description of an ominous item that Bruce had
found in the desk drawer, way in the back behind an assortment innocent
office supplies. It was an small, old lunchbox tin. Inside was a thick
plastic bag with a label printed on the side that read in anonymous
Helvetica</p>
<p>“Palnbuethesole. Trial only. Take one dose every 36 hours.”</p>
<p>The final paragraph detailed how inside the bag were exactly
twenty-three small individually-sealed plastic pouches, each with a
single small white tablet with no markings. And on the outer bag
opposite the label was a green sticky-note with red ink which hastily
spelled</p>
<p>“Do not take. Keep safe. Find source.”</p>
<p>Halfway through that last paragraph, the page had clearly been torn
away. Several following pages appeared to be torn out as well, which I
deduced from a few remnant corners left in the staple. I then put the
notes</p>
