<p><u>Abstract</u></p>
<p>Analogies are easily misused, with great effectiveness, as if they
are arguments or explanations. Still, analogies can be used well to make
a claim intuitive after it has been justified.</p>
</div>
<p>An <em>analogy</em> is a claim that two things, \(X\) and \(Y\) are
'the same' with respect to some aspect \(P\). As popularly deployed,
analogies come in a variety of styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>metaphor</em> – "\(X\) is \(Y\) (<em>implicitly:</em> with
respect to \(P\))"; commonly idiomatic</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. "the news is music to my ears"</li>
<li>e.g. "time is money"</li>
<li>e.g. "my memory is foggy"</li>
<li>e.g. "the building is a maze"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>simile</em> – "\(X\) is like \(Y\) (<em>implicitly:</em> with
respect to \(P\))" or "\(X\) is as \(P\) as \(Y\)"</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. "the desert was like an ocean of sand"</li>
<li>e.g. "the empty suitcase is as light as a feather"</li>
<li>e.g. "the paper is as white as snow"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>allegory</em> – a story about the \(P\) of \(X\) that
parallels the \(P\) of \(Y\)</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. the story "Animal Farm" by George Orwell is about the
corruption of a animal-managed farm that parallels the corruption of
communism in the Russian Revolution of 1917</li>
<li>e.g. <span><a href="https://aesopfables.com"><img

fox and the grapes" which parallels the propensity to publically deride
that which one desires but cannot achieve</li>
<li>e.g. the Star Trek episode "A Private Little War" which parallels
the US involvement in the Vietnam War</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>anecdote</em> – claim about the \(P\) of \(X\) as an example
of the \(P\) of \(Y\)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Here is an example of a young mother who is worrying about how to
secure her children's next meal. Poor people in this neighborhood have
it hard."</li>
<li>"Here is my experience in the field of underwater basket-weaving.
You can expect to have a similar experience to mine."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Analogy can be a useful way to communicate an intuition about the
\(P\) of \(Y\) be appealing to an intuition about the \(P\) of \(X\). As
an example of both analogy's usefulness and of anecdote:</p>

<p>For teaching about electric current in introductory physics courses,
an often useful analogy is that between <span><a
href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/watcir.html"><img
src="/missing.ico" class="favicon" alt="/missing.ico" />electric current
in a circuit and water current in a pipe</a><span

A circuit is like a pipe system, voltage is like pressure, and
resistance is like pipe diameter. Since the flowing of water in a pipe
is immediately intuitive, using this analogy allows some of that
intuition for electric circuits. The difficult, complicated, and
unfamiliar behavior of electricity in circuits can be roughly
reorganized to follow different abstract but intuitive rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The analogy between electric circuits and water pipes is appealing,
especially before a detailed understanding of the underlying
electrodynamics. But an analogy can only go so far if the analogized
things are not identical (in which case we would have the identity
analogy). Electric circuits are like water pipes in a few high-level
respects, but not in the vast majority of other respects. Why doesn't
electricity 'spill out' of a circuit with loose ends?</p>
<p>Overall, the water pipes analogy gives you an intuition about
electric current, but that intuition <em>didn't actually teach you
anything about electric current</em> (no matter how much it may
<em>feel</em> like you've learned something). Even the analogical claim
that electric circuits are like water pipes in a few particular respects
is not really something about electric circuits themselves, but
extrinsically about the relationship between water pipes and electric
circuits.</p>
<p>I think that this observation is very often covertly sidestepped or
just ignored. Analogies so commonly are given as if they were arguments
and even explanations – all the time! Generally, there are two main
tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The \(P\) of \(X\) is that because \(X\) is like \(Y\)
(<em>implicitly:</em> with respect to \(P\)) and the \(P\) of \(Y\) is
that"
<ul>
<li>The analogy "\(X\) is like \(Y\) with respect to \(P\)" is used as
if it were an explanation, but it explains nothing about \(X\) itself
and relies purely on the extrinsic comparison between \(X\) and
\(Y\)</li>
<li>e.g. "The Vietnam War is bad because the conflict in Star Trek's 'A
Private Little War', which critiques the Vietnam War, is bad"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"\(X\) is like \(Y\) with respect to \(Q\) because \(X\) is like
\(Y\) (<em>implicitly:</em> with respect to \(P\))."
<ul>
<li>The conclusion sneaks in a new aspect \(Q\) that may look
superficially similar or related to \(P\), but is not implied by \(P\).
<ul>
<li>e.g. "A country's citizenry is like a big family, so a country
should not let in anyone who is not like family."</li>
<li>e.g. "Computers are just big fancy calculators, so we shouldn't
expect a computer to every be as intelligent as a human."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: more examples of bad analogical arguments</p>
<p>I've argued that these argument tactics are misuses of analogy, but
to be clear they are only misuses when they are used in place of good
arguments. It is so easy to use analogy in place of arguments because
analogies are very persuasive, satisfying, and by nature intuitive. But
analogical arguments have these attractive qualities regardless of
whether they are being used to support a good or a bad argument.</p>
<p>My warnings given, analogy does have many good uses, including in
arguments. I began with the claim that "Analogy can be a useful way to
communicate an intuition about the \(P\) of \(Y\) be appealing to an
intuition about the \(P\) of \(X\)," which is still true even if the
analogy doesn't at all <em>justify that</em> or <em>explain why</em> the
\(P\) of \(X\) and the \(P\) of \(Y\) are the same. My ideal use of
analogy is to first demonstrate and explain how the \(P\) of \(X\) is
the same as the \(P\) of \(Y\), and then explain how this gives rise to
an intuitive analogy between \(X\) and \(Y\) with respect to \(P\).</p>
<p>Many analogies reflect a deeper truth about a shared nature of \(X\)
and \(Y\) that accounts for why the \(P\) of \(X\) is the same as the
\(P\) of \(Y\). From the observation that electric circuits behave
similarly to water pipes in the mentioned respects, to learn what laws
of nature are acting similarly on these two very different kinds of
systems is really to learn something new about circuits and pipes, as
well as learning something more general about all systems that are acted
upon by natural laws in the same way.</p>
<p>This process of <em>generalization</em> is very powerful and the
center of what most people consider the pursuit of interesting
knowledge. What makes information interesting is it's ability to explain
many different aspects of a domain in a concise way. The most
interesting mathematical theorems lend insight into a large range of
interesting questions. The most interesting algorithms demonstrate
strategies that abstract over large classes of tasks. The most
interesting literature/film/etc. reflect situations that many people
experience in many different ways.</p>
<p>But what is the difference between analogy and generalization? Well,
analogy is a rhetorical style of generalization – one that seems
particularly intuitive to most people. However, as it is used, analogy
is only the <em>claim</em> of generalization, rather than the process of
developing and accounting for the generalization.</p>
<p>Consider Aesop's fable of "the fox and the grapes". The story is
entertaining and makes sense because, as a human audience, we already
have an intuitive understanding of the sense of spite the fox ends up
feeling because it cannot get the grapes. The story did not instill nor
explain that understanding; the story embodies the claim that the
phenomenon is common and natural, and little else. Perhaps the story
highlights an observation that the claim seems to be true, but even that
relies on the fact that the audience can instinctually derive the claim
from the story.</p>
<p>Consider George Orwell's "Animal Farm". The story is not just the
analogical claim that the Russian Revolution's communist ideals (and,
perhaps, optimistic communist ideals in general) were corrupted. The
story gives a step-by-step account for how, gradually, the populace of
well-meaning and optimistic revolutionaries are taken advantage of
leaders who know how to say just what they want to hear in the right
style of language in order to get away with injustice. The story itself
is an abstract explanation for how the analogy between the animal farm
and the revolutionary communists holds – importantly, the story is not
just an assertion that the analogy holds. Reading the story can provide
some understanding of how optimistic revolutionary movements can be
corrupted, which is made intuitive and non-specific by the allegory to a
managable set of characters who's cartoonish actions are abstractions of
the complex situations that occur in real-world revolutions.</p>
