<p>In particular, VRChat is the only "social" applications listed here.
And in it, even though I was in online lobbies with many other people,
the experience did not feel very social since I wasn't outgoing enough
to try and make friends with people in the short amount of time I was
there.</p>
<p>I was not very impressed with social VR. In VRChat (which I will
introduce in more detail in the <span><span
class="sidenote preview">VRChat<br/><em><a href="#VRChat"
title="_blank"><img src="/favicon.ico" class="favicon"
alt="/favicon.ico" />rybl.net</a></em><br/>TODO:
baseDescription</span><a href="#VRChat"><img src="/favicon.ico"
class="favicon" alt="/favicon.ico" />VRChat</a></span> section), there
were a few times I came close to having an actual conversation with
someone else, but without the pretense of knowing that we are trying to
talk to each other, it was a little hard to start conversations.
Sometimes, people would approach me and show me stuff, but they would
leave just as quickly, and were usually with other people they were
talking to primarily.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nBEWCsmq-Yk/maxresdefault.jpg"
alt="VRChat" /></p>
<p>VRChat is also just a crazy place -- it reminds me of early amateur
YouTube. Almost everything is user-made, so every world has its own
ad-hoc aesthetic and hacky interactive features. And, of course, the
avatars. There's a rediculously huge variety of user-made avatars. And
as far as I can tell, moderation is pretty relaxed so its typical to run
into giant monsters that cover your view and spin wildly, random
characters that play music or recordings of lines from movies or TV
shows.</p>
<p>I also briefly tried RecRoom (which I will introduce in more detail
in the section <span><span class="sidenote preview">RecRoom<br/><em><a
href="#RecRoom" title="_blank"><img src="/favicon.ico" class="favicon"
alt="/favicon.ico" />rybl.net</a></em><br/>TODO:
baseDescription</span><a href="#RecRoom"><img src="/favicon.ico"
class="favicon" alt="/favicon.ico" />RecRoom</a></span>) one time
recently. I think its much less well-known than VRChat, so I hadn't
heard about it until then. Overall I was very impressed with the UX. The
avatars and worlds were much more constrained than VRChat's, so the
performance was much more optimized and the experience overall much more
organized. I attended a VR talent show that was pretty funny, although
most of the contestants were middle-to-high-school kids singing badly
singing pop songs (sometimes multiple consecutive contestants sung that
same pop song...). I had a positive experience, but wasn't exactly sure
what I was interested in doing next. The games weren't as fun as other
VR games I already had.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a funny gimmick to see the early stages of social VR,
but I only participated in social VR around 5 times during 6 months.</p>

Chance</a></h1>
<p>Listening the Meta and technology enthusiasts talk about the promises
of social VR, I started to wonder if there's something that I missed
from my previous experiences. The main thing, I noticed, was vising a
friend or some aquaintance that I could actually chat with persistently
and have some benchmark to compare to (talking with them physically). I
didn't, however, go as far as to install Meta's Horizon Worlds. But,
given the positive results of the following experiment, I may be willing
to try it once in the future.</p>
<p>I invited a friend, who will go by QMD in this article, who I talk
with (via text) frequently online to join me in VR via his <span><span

<p>VRChat hadn't changed much since that last time I used it a few
months earlier. But, it has certainly improved a lot over its
lifetime.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, VRChat is a free VR application where you can
visit user-created private/public virtual worlds. You exist in these

<p>QMD and I donned avatars and explored some random VRChat words.
VRChat has these notable capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locations are organized into worlds. You can find world via a
primitive search menu, or through hub worlds or other users that
advertise certain worlds to you. Some worlds are static, intended for
socializing or serving as a base to implement special activities on top
of, and some worlds are designed to host a specific interactive game or
other experience.</li>
<li>Voice chat is distance sensitive; the volume of a person's voice is
proportional to how close they are to you.</li>
<li>Your avatar tracks the movement of your head (via your headset) and
hands (via your controllers or hand-tracking such as on the Oculus Quest
2). Additionally, most avatars have animations that make the character
faux-lipsync, blink periodically, and move other limbs and attachments
(e.g. legs, clothing, equipment, hair) to give the impression of
physics.</li>
<li>You can move and jump like in a typical 3D video game. This usually
causes motion sickness however, so many newer users use <em>teleport
movement mode</em> instead, which lets you use your controller as a
pointer to choose where to teleport to, without inducing motion in your
view.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start, we explored a few different worlds and talked to some
random users. Most of the users we met were male children -- by the
sound of their voices, in the age range 8-14. Most people used anime or
cartoon avatars.</p>
<p><img
src="https://vrlowdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VRChat-avatar-worlds-big-als-avatar-corridors.jpg"
alt="an example VRChat avatar galery world" /></p>
<p>We met a particularly enthusiastic young user who guided us to a
world that hosts a sort of avatar gallery, which was vast. While the
avatars are all cartoonish, some of them were extremely sexual and
sometimes even explicitly so. Many avatars had special <em>emotes</em>
which are pre-rendered animations of the avatar doing a short expression
such as dancing, clapping, jumping, smiling, shooting a laser gun, etc.
The intention for some emotes seemed to be to truly emote i.e.
communicate a certain expression. But, in our experience the emotes were
exclusively used to show off something cool about the avatar.</p>
<p>One avatar I found particularly interesting was a squid puppet. The
avatar was invisible except for a cute little cartoon squid attached to
your right hand. So, you could control the squid as a puppet. While this
avatar was cool, the problem with it was that you couldn't really use it
to communicate effectively with other people since it didn't track the
motion of your head or other arms, or have an animated mouth while you
talked.</p>
<p>We explored a few other worlds to see what kinds of stuff people
usually do in VRChat. There were some RP (role-playing) worlds, such as
an RP Drama Court where people debated some joke criminal charges
against a volunteered user. There were also many game-focused worlds
such as a Tron-like laser disk game. Everything was user generated, so
UIs were often very clunky and poorly explained, so you just kinda had
to go around and tinker with things to see what happened. Most of the
places we stayed had somewhere between 10 to 15 people. So, I'm guessing
that around 15 people is the max number of users in most worlds. When
the number of users overflows, the overflow users are typically sent to
a parallel copy of the world.</p>
<p>Communicating with people was generally pretty difficult, but not
impossible. You had to try hard to get people's attention, when they
were usually focused on talking with their current group of VRChat
friends. There were few visual indications that someone you were trying
to talk to was acknowledging you. Even if they turned to face you, there
was no clear sense of eye contact. Additionally, some computationally
intense worlds and avatars caused QMD and my programs to lag, which
further hindered communication in a similar way to laggy video chat.
However, almost always we found at least 1 person who was somewhat
helpful or responsive when QMD and I wanted it. Suprisingly, we didn't
experience any harassment, joke-intended or otherwise.</p>
<p>Eventually, QMD and I settled down in a more "chill" world styled
like an old Japanese village -- that is, a static world meant for
hanging out and talking rather than a game or other interactive
experience. We went upstairs into what looked like a restaurant and sat
next to a large window, which looked out over the town. It was very
pleasant in comparison to what some might call the assault on the senses
which was our experience so far. Still, there was someone else in the
village that was transforming into a large dinosaur or something, which
was distracting, so we configured <em>earmuff mode</em> which limited
our hearing to just people within a few meters.</p>
<h3 id="vrchat-review">§ <a href="#vrchat-review"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">VRChat Review</a></h3>
<p>QMD and I took physical and virtual seats to review our experience so
far. How does our communication in VRChat compare to our physical
interactions? For context, we both live in the USA, but far away from
each other, so we usually only physically see each other once a year or
so when we visit our hometown.</p>
<p><em>Attention.</em> One on one, it was actually much easier to get a
sense of whether the other person's avatar was looking at you, or was
paying attention to something else (such at looking out the window or
interacting with a personal menu). The correspondence of the avatar's
head to your physical head was correlated enough that you could
distinguish whether the other person was looking at the table between
you or at you yourself, but since there is no eye tracking this accuracy
was limited to head rotation. So, for example, it was hard to tell where
exactly on the table the other person is looking since usually you just
move your head in the general direction of the (normal-sized) table, and
then move your eyes to pay attention to something specific on the
table.</p>
<p><em>Natural Conversation.</em> In audio and video calls, a common
problem is accidentally talking over the other person since visual
queues are impossible or harder to notice in time, especially with the
introduced delay, in comparison to physical conversation. In VRChat,
this effect is slightly mitigated by the availability of physical queues
such as hand and head motion. When the other is talking while moving
their hands, and then the make a finalizing gesture and stop talking,
you know that you can start talking without a conflict. Or, when its
ambiguous who should talk next, you can make a gesture towards the other
person rather than say "you go" which could lead to another conflict.
However, there is still a little lag (about the same as audio call, not
as bad as many video calls). Overall, it seems like the additional body
language provided by both head and hand movement is enough to noticably
improve the sense of natural communication over video calling. But video
has some other advantages as well, in particular the lack of facial
expressions. Meta is <span><span class="sidenote preview">working on

<p><em>Avatar Projection.</em> To some extent its still can be
inherently hard to make it feel natural when your conversation partner
is a giant robot or sexy anime cat girl. But not all of that
unnaturalness is bad, of course. Although avatars have some artistic
details, they are hugely simplfied in comparison to the details of a
person's physical appearance. People choose an avatar in order to be
funny, cute, or stylized for whatever preference. In order to have a
casual conversation, QMD and I used simple avatars that didn't have a
lot of moving pieces so that we could focus on talking rather than
messing around with emotes. Its fun to have your appearance abstracted
in this way to something that you have full control over. When you go up
to someone new, its straightforward to pre-judge them based on their
appearance, and you don't need to give a second though to how their
physical body actually looks because for all intents and purposes that
doesn't matter in this context. Some of the users QMD and I talked to
mentioned that they liked VRChat because it let them be social without
experiencing anxiety, presumably for exposing their physical body and
mannerisms to new people. In VRChat, the full control over your avatar's
appearance (as well as the ability to leave at any moment) provides a
buffer between you and other people that can make it easier to be
outgoing and experimental. My guess is that a big factor here is that it
feels like you aren't risking as much in a status game in these
interactions, because of that buffer.</p>
<p><em>Shared Presence.</em> A huge advantage of VR interactions
compared to audio and video calls is the shared presence it provides you
and your conversation partner. You each have your own perspective in the
physical world, but you can experience that same things together.
Thinking back to the time I spent with QMD in VRChat, it feels more like
we visited a <em>place</em> rather than just playing the same game
together. Above that, in contrast to playing non-VR video games
together, the controlling a humanoid character in the VRChat worlds that
the other person can react to contributes to a sense of bodily
immeresion. What I was really left wanting, however, was the ability to
share a computer screen, so I could show the other person something I
looked up online, for example. What we really needed in VR was the
equivalent of a tablet. I'm sure that something like this is possible,
its just a matter of UI design. So, I'm very interested to see where
that sort of feature becomes available.</p>
<h2 id="recroom">§ <a href="#recroom"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">RecRoom</a></h2>

<p>After VRChat, QMD and I decided to try out <span><span
class="sidenote preview">RecRoom<br/><em><a href="https://recroom.com/"
title="_blank"><img src="/favicon/recroom.com.png" class="favicon"
alt="/favicon/recroom.com.png" />https://recroom.com/</a></em><br/>Placeholder
description for https://recroom.com/</span><a
href="https://recroom.com/"><img src="/favicon/recroom.com.png"
class="favicon" alt="/favicon/recroom.com.png" />RecRoom</a></span>.
I've used RecRoom briefly before, but QMD hadn't.</p>
<p>RecRoom is similar to VRChat in the sense that it is also a free VR
application where you can visit dev-created and user-created
private/public virtual worlds. You exist in these worlds as a
configurable avatar, but the avatar is very constrained compared to
VRChat. The vanilla avatar body is very basic, and the accessories such
as clothing and hair styles can only be acquired through an in-game shop
that costs money (after converting it to in-game currency, of
course).</p>
<p>QMD and I met in my <em>dorm room</em>, which is a private room that
every user starts with. It has a white board with markers, mini
basketball ball/hoop, water bottle (with crude particle effects when the
water is poured out), a desk, a bed, and a mirror. So, an extremely
luxurious dorm room. I was curious to see if the white board was
effective for communicating written ideas to each other, and it roughly
was. Drawing on it was basically as fine-grained as a real whiteboard.
But, it was too small.</p>
<p>The aesthetic of RecRoom seems to be going for faux realism, where UI
and game elements are depicted as if they were the physical analogues
you'd see in the physical world. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the quick game menu is accessible by looking at your wrist as if you
were wearing a watch</li>
<li>doors which lead to other worlds are passed through by actually
reaching out and opening the door</li>
<li>accepting people into your party is performed by fist-bumping
them</li>
</ul>
<p>This definitely works in favor of an intuitive UX, and a somewhat
immersive experience, but at times it does interfere with the efficiency
of navigating menus and using things. Like, I would have preferred the
whiteboard in my dorm room to be bigger, and the markers to be more
fine-grained and pressure-insensitive.</p>
<p>RecRoom seems to have a focus on providing amateur in-game creation
tools, such as the <em>maker gun</em>, which is a sort of advanced 3D
pen that you can use in private areas. The structured you make can be
moved around, but don't have physics properties. QMD and I played around
with this briefly while inside my dorm room.</p>
<p>Then, QMD and I went to the central hub world, the Rec Center, where
we were again taken under the wing of a young-sounding user. He brought
us to a horror-themed game world. The game was pretty boring, so we only
tried it out for a few minutes before moving on. Over the next 2 hours
we tried out paddleball, frisbee golf, paintball, bowling, and an escape
room. The were all fairly impressive in how well-made they were, with
paddleball, frisbee golf, and bowling standing out as very fun. The best
thing we were looking for was something that we could do together while
also chatting casually with each other. None of the games were
particularly impressive as standalone games, but with a social aspect to
them, they were perfect.</p>
<p><img

alt="Bowling in RecRoom" /></p>
<p>I noticed that, since our avatars were less interesting, we spent
less time looking at each other's avatars than just talking while
passively doing other activities. This worked out pretty well, since its
kinda awkward to, such as in a video call, just stare at the other
person while you are having a conversation with them. In VRChat this was
more normal because of how visually stimulating people's avatars
were.</p>
<p>Most of the worlds that we visited in RecRoom were dev-created, such
as the paddleball and bowling. But, the escape room was definitely
user-generated, which was apparent from its lack of polish and
"minimalist" instructions. There definitely seems to be a lot of
user-generated content in RecRoom, but we were satisfied enough with the
dev-created worlds we tried for a few hours that we didn't end up trying
many of user-created ones.</p>
<h3 id="recroom-review">§ <a href="#recroom-review"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">RecRoom Review</a></h3>
<p><em>Attention.</em> One of the restrictions that comes with the
avatars is that RecRoom's developers decided to make the avatars
simplified floating torsos with unconnected hands and a head. In
particular, the avatars don't have legs or arms. This didn't turn out to
limit expressiveness much in my opinion, since you don't have direct
control over your avatar's legs and arms in VRChat anyways. The facial
expressions of the RecRoom avatars aren't very complicated either,
although they do seem to respond to a few stimuli (e.g. if you throw
something at an avatar, it will cause their face to briefly have a
pained expression). It was harder to tell where each other were looking
by looking at each other's faces, since the eyes of RecRoom avatars are
much less detailed (they're basicallyj just stylized black dots). But,
this never was an issue since the things we were interacting with were
big enough that we didn't need to worry about precisely tracking each
other's head movements -- general head-facing direction was sufficient
information.</p>
<p><em>Natural Conversation.</em> This was basically the same as VRChat.
Even with minimalist expressions of just simple faces on a head floating
above a torso with floating hands, using body language while talking
worked pretty much just as well as in VRChat. In fact, I think it
usually worked a little better because the bodies of the RecRoom avatars
are much easier to read than some of the weird VRChat avatars.</p>
<p><em>Avatar Projection.</em> Since the avatars are also so similar,
the appearance of your avatar doesn't realy express that much detail
about your choices. In fact, at one point QMD notified me that somehow I
had put on a dress without realizing it. I didn't really care, since the
details of our avatars weren't very important -- I didn't feel the
compulsion to mess around with configuring my avatar like I did in
VRChat.</p>
<p><em>Shared Presence.</em> Since the environments felt more realistic
and immersive than the VRChat environments, I could make more sense of
them visually and intuitively, and therefore it felt much more like a
shared <em>place</em> to visit with QMD than many of the VRChat worlds.
Still, however, having tablets to use collaboratively inside of RecRoom
would be a great feature which should be added as soon as possible.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions"><a href="#conclusions"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Conclusions</a></h1>
<p>What was new about this experience was that I shared it with someone
that I have interacted with physically and in non-VR games many times
before. In this way, I had an implicit benchmark to compare my VR
interactions to like I haven't had in my VR interactions with random
people online.</p>
<p>With this in mind, overall, I was impressed with how much of the
interactivity of physical interaction transfered to VR interaction. Of
course, there are things that we could have done physically (such as get
food) that are pretty much impossible to meaningfully transfer to VR,
but there are also many things that we could do in VR that are
impossible or very inconvenient to do physically, such as visiting
interesting worlds and playing Tron laser disk battle, bowling, and
paintball. Along these lines, I see hanging out in VR as a way to
improve the experience of playing video games together. I would prefer
to play mini golf, bowling, and similar games in VR with someone over
getting together in person to do it, even if the person is close enough
to me to feasibly join me for such an activity in person.</p>
<p>When it comes to the pure social experience of focusing on talking
with someone, I was definitely impressed by the VR experience, but its
still lacking in some critical aspects compared to the physical social
expperience, and I'd say the lack of facial expressions is by far the
biggest of these. I'm very interested in seeing how progress in the
technology for that and its adoption goes, since I then that will be a
huge improvement that could draw many more people in social VR, if its
done well of course.</p>
<p>I'll say this again as well -- having a tablet in VR would be a huge
benefit. So many times when I'm spending time with someone in person, we
have a computer open or are sharing things from each other's phones. Its
so annoying to access your computer and phone while you're in VR, and
always a disappointment when you can't share your view desktop or phone
with other people. I'm not sure how this exactly should be implemented,
but something like a mini desktop that you could spawn into the world
would be a good start.</p>
<p>I see current social VR as good for socializing with friends that you
don't see regularly in person. In the near term future, it could be an
ideal medium for audio-visual interactions such as podcasts, planning,
and team meetings. I could easily imagine hosting a podcast in VR --
maybe Yuta and I will try that someday. I also mention team meetings
since it can be cumbersome to get several people to come to the same
location to meet for an extended period that involves primarily sitting
down around a table or at a whiteboard doing things you mostly prefer
doing in your own workspace. But, meeting in person has proven, at least
for the kinds of meetings I have, to have many benefits over video
calling. My hypothesis is that much that is lost going from physical
meetings to video calls is preserved by VR interactions.</p>
<p>Lastly, in retrospect, I feel like I had more fun in RecRoom than
VRChat since it was easier to specifically focus on talking with QMD
rather than getting distracted with complicated avatars and random
bullshit happening all around us. There is definitely something lost
there though, where VRChat feels more exciting and RecRoom feels more
predictable. More generally, VRChat feels like it has much more content
and much more variety of content overall, so I could see there being
particular worlds I would be interested in enough to boot up VRChat
specifically to visit, but none of the worlds I've seen so far qualify.
Finally, if I was inviting someone to hang out with me in VR for the
first time, I would choose RecRoom over VRChat pretty much every
time.</p>
