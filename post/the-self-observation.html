description for
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30658.Meditations_on_First_Philosophy</span></span></em>,
Descartes drowns himself in doubt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is as if I had suddenly falled into a deep whirlpool; I am so
tossed about that I can neither touchbottom with my foot, nor swim up to
the top."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doubt is, he claims, the most extreme possible doubt. He strives
to doubt everything that can possibly be doubted to any degree. He
rejects any certainty of the senses and even of the ability of his
cognition to properly understand mathematical demonstrations. Descartes'
goal is to find anything undoubtable, save a certainty that nothing is
certain.</p>
<p>After moving his considerations to higher and higher abstractions of
experience, he comes to a crucial question: <em>"Do I exist?"</em> In
more general terms: "Does the self exist?"</p>
<p>Descartes continues: Well, no, surely not for certain. It is possible
that the self does not exist. If all is in doubt, then why should the
self escape unscathed? The moment-to-monent experience of there being an
agent who experiences, and perhaps wills, is merely an experience itself
and lends no credence to the existence of the objects it projects any
more than the senses render certain the existence of one's hands and
feet (as was previously considered as a ready target for the doubt).
"There are only thoughts," Descartes concludes. "there are thoughts, but
there is no 'I'."</p>
<p>Of course, this last paragraph is a lie. That is not at all what
Descartes concludes in his second meditation. Rather, he expresses the
opposite sentiment: "I think, therefor I exist." He reflects on the fact
that, throughout his meditation so far, <em>he</em> has been thinking,
doubting, assenting, rejecting, imagining, etc. To reflect on these
experiences, there must be a common subject. In order to have the
thoughts of doubt about the content other thoughts, there must have been
a subject for both thoughts. "I think, therefor I am."</p>
<p>But why did I present the second-previous paragraph? To mislead the
reader? Yes, but not only that. My point is that, at that point in his
meditation, there were two paths open to Descartes. He could either
assent to the existence of the self, or he could withold such assent,
keeping that existence in doubt. This desicion by Descartes, I argue,
was optional.</p>
<p>First, consider the consideration presented in the third-previous
paragraph: the self is doubtable. This leads to a sort of Buddhist
approach to introspection, where one realizes that there is no
persistent self, and that there are only instantaneous experiences. In
this view, a concept of "the self" is completely superfluous, for no
evidence of it is anywhere to be found in such a meditation. Any
evidence forced into view, such as the common appearance of a persistent
self, can be easily doubted and discarded as being contrived and
unnatural.</p>
<p>Second: consider the consideration presented in the third-previous
paragarph: the self is undoubtable. For after all, if the self was
doubtable, who would it be doubtable by? This yeilds the following
options: either the self is doubtable by some unspecified doubter, or
undoubtable by the self on the other. An easy solution is to just call
the "unspecified doubter" by "the self". This is similar to the thought
experiment where one does not have one's own thoughts but merely has
some other thinker's thoughts. Under Descartes' doubt thus far, there is
no way to distiguish this hypothetical "other thinker" from the
self.</p>
<p>Under Descartes' doubt, he has to additionally take the step to
reflect on the previous thoughts in order to reach the self. In this
move, is Descartes inventing a new entity where none existed before? Is
he merely contriving a superfluous concept that rests above his
<em>basic</em> experience? No. As Descartes realizes it, the self is a
purely basic experience and not a constructed entity. However, the self
is indeed a new entity that exists where none existed before. The self
is self-reflection. Through the meditation, Descartes became aware of an
entity whose existence is exactly that awareness. This recursive
relationship between the self and itself is the essence of the self.
When Descartes later goes on to observe what sort of thing the self is
--- "I am a thinking thing" --- he is observing not only that the self
has thoughts but that the those thoughts are about the self.</p>
<p>The option to realize the self, to self-reflect, is indeed optional.
Suppose there is a dog that never has the experience of understanding
that it is a self that is the haver of its thoughts (I judge this is a
conceivable scenerio). Then <em>does there exist</em> a self for this
dog? No. There is no need to say anything above that there are
dog-experiences of which I wouldn't know much how to explain. Is there a
point of view to these experiences? Sure. The experience of sight has a
spacial perspective, and similarly with all other aspects of experience.
But if there is no self-reflection, there is no experience of the self,
and thus no self.</p>
<p>In a similar way, suppose there is a Buddhist monk that rejects the
existence of the self. When the monk introspects, observes thoughts and
observes that those experiences have perspecgives, then need not go any
further than notice that. So they have no experience of a self, and thus
have no self</p>
<p>The options are: - to accept the self; to self-reflect and find
something new. - to reject the self; to reflect on experience and not
find anything new.</p>
