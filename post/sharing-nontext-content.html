<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Sharing text online in the form of urls, quotes, or just raw text has
been a core part of how content is shared online. For almost any kind of
content on the internet, even nontext content such as video or audio,
there is always an associated url that links to it or some
representative text. However, I think that this leaves a lot of room for
improvement as nontext content becomes a more developed medium.</p>
<p>The following sections outline a few features that I think take
better advantage of how nontext context is consumed on the internet.</p>
<h1 id="splicing">Splicing</h1>
<p>Currently, YouTube offers a functionality for tagging a video link
with a <em>start</em> time. When the link is opened, the video will load
the video player with the head set to the given time. This feature is so
useful because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is annoying to separately communicate timestamps if just a
certain part of the video is of interest.</li>
<li>Navigating a video without context is often cumbersome, and is
especially difficult on mobile. Thus, the <em>start</em> time function
serves a legitimate purpose. It is also the first step towards a suite
of similar, potention features that add only slightly more
complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most obviously, a <em>stop</em> time function could behave
symmetrically. This feature would be useful because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often when a certain part of a video is of interest, it is not just
the entire video after the specified <em>start</em> time but just a
small section of it.</li>
<li>After watching the video for some amount of time, the user has to
decide at what point to stop the video. This choice is often made
arbitrarily and counter to the sender's intention.</li>
<li>A user usually takes length heavily into account when deciding
whether or not to watch a video or video segment. An unspecified length
of a shared video segement may be less appealing than a specified
length.</li>
<li>Sections of videos could be more easily linked to in the context of
citation, putting both a left and right bound around where a citation
references in the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube currently offers another functionality called Playlists where
a user can aggregate a selection of YouTube videos in a specified order.
If YouTube offered both <em>start</em> and <em>stop</em> time functions,
then a user could make a Playlist that included videos that only play a
specified section when watched as part of the playlist. I think this
would be a hugely useful tool for YouTube users that want to share
bundles of videos, especially longer ones, but currently need to
actually splice together the videos off-platform and then upload the
product as an independent video. If users could splice together videos
using the <em>start</em> and <em>stop</em> time functions in Playlists,
then Playlists become a super easy way to do this that preserves all
easy-to-follow links to the original video sources (for instance, to
watch context around the spliced section). Perhaps even, a creator could
splice their own video content into the Playlist as a way to easily do
commentary that preserves the original sources.</p>
<p>I describe these features in the context of YouTube because I am most
familiar with its <em>start</em> time function, but in theory it would
work just as well with any video or audio. For audio, the ability to
link to specified sections of podcasts and splice together small
sections of several episodes would be very useful for sharing small bits
of longer pieces of content. Currently, there is not even a
<em>start</em> time function for the largest podcast application Apple
Podcasts.</p>
<p>There are other possible functions in this area such as a YouTube
function for Playlists that play two videos side-by-side or in some sort
of overlapping arrangement. I think, however, that there will develop a
relatively clear line between what people are interested in making use
of inside YouTube's interface and what they will prefer to do in other
ways (e.g. the raw video source). For example, I predict that not many
people would make use of the parallel-videos Playlist functionlity just
mentioned.</p>
<h1 id="timestamped-comments">Timestamped Comments</h1>
<p>For text-centric content such as articles, a commenter can easily
refer to a part of the article by quoting the section. But for nontext
content the analogous capabilities are very clunky. Two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube comments can reference a specific time via text in order to
generate a link to the video at that time in the published comment. It's
annoying to transcribe the timestamp, especially since its difficult to
navigate a specific time on mobile</li>
<li>Soundcloud comments are all timestamped, and can only be viewed by
navigating to the part of the song the comment is at. This is extremely
stupid because no one reads the comments as the randomly flash during
the song - most of the comments are insignificant and if there are many
comments near each other, it's impossible to navigate. Additionally,
most of the comments have no reason for being linked to a specific time
in the song.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these and many other ways, the idea of timestamped comments has
been addressed superficially. However, for longer-form video and audio
especially, timestamped comments can be very useful. For example in a
podcast, the analogous act to quoting a section of an article would be
to quote to a span of time in the podcast.</p>
<p>The actual UI implementation of this feature seems to be a main
sticking point. YouTube's automatically-recognized timestamps are a good
approach to start with. The next step would be to allow a user to select
the time rather to be the current time of the player or by allowing a
scrubber interfact for choosing a timestamp. This removes the middle
step of reading, remembering, and then typing the timestamp.</p>
