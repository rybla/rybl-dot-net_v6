<div class="header-info">
<p><u>Published:</u> 2021-11-01</p>
<p><u>Tags:</u> philosophy</p>
<p><u>Abstract</u></p>
<p>Do you choose to belief something, or do you recognize that you
already believe it?</p>
</div>
<p>My intuition is that belief is not a choice. When someone asks me if
I believe that the sky is blue, I don't decide to believe the sky is
blue and then say "yes, I believe the sky is blue". Instead, I
introspect and notice that yes, I believe the sky is blue, and then say
"yes, I believe the sky is blue".</p>
<p>As a less trivial example, if in an argument I am asked if I believe
the thing I was originally arguing for, I introspect and consider
whether or not I still believe it after thinking about what the other
person has said. This process doesn't <em>feel</em> like making a
choice. If the other person has convinced me, then I notice that I feel
like I am noticing that I have been convinced. It doesn't feel like it
is up to me whether or not to be convinced, it just happens.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn't as simple as this though. In an arugment, there
can often come a point where I am "on the edge" about a question ---
based on what I've thought about so far, I could see my belief going
either way. But not strongly. At this point, its useful to consider the
idea of <em>credence</em>, which is the degree of beleif. When I say
that I believe something, what I usually mean is that I have a
reasonably high (certainly more than 50%) credence in it. So if I could
see the argument convincing me either way, my credence is very close to
50%. Under this view, perhaps my belief is not really in question yet,
because it doesn't seem like my credence will swing significantly enough
towards on direction or the other in order to become strong enough to be
called a belief, without further consideration. The counter to this
would be that I could <em>choose</em> to swing my credence significantly
enough to yield a belief.</p>
<p>A common sticking point here and in the free will debate is on the
meaning of "choice". One approach is to try to define "choose" as a
fundamental physical action that humans (at least) can do with their
minds. This approach leads quickly to the conclusion that there really
is no such thing as choice because there could not be some basic
physical action that minds can do that isn't explainable in terms of
just the more basic physical processes that clearly arent under the
human mind's control (some are deterministic, some are stochastic).
While this is sometimes used as an argument against the existence of
(libertarian) free will, it is actually a reductio ad absurdum of the
approach itself. This shouldn't be an argument about the definition of
words, it should be about the actual <em>thing</em> that we refer to
when we say "choice". Choice is a social construct (as opposed to a
physical one) that is used to refer to actual actions all the time, so
it certainly exists. To refute its existence is to deny that people can
communicate meaning with language. Note, however, that I am not claiming
that everyone's conceptions about the properties of choice are true ---
I am only asserting that "choice" refers to something real, even if its
users would also make false claims about the things being referred to.
I.e. "choice" means whatever kind of thing it is that is referred to
when people talk about choice.</p>
<p>With this consideration, come back to the concern about choosing to
believe. It does sometimes appear that people end up believing what they
believe regardless of their desire to believe otherwise. Even if I try
to believe the sky is green, I cannot. At the same time, it also
sometimes appear that people choose to believe what they believe. Often
this happens by them making a series of choices that leave them in a
circumstance where they are strongly influenced to believe something,
and sometimes even a person appears to just decide to believe something
on the spot by an act of will. Even in these latter situations, usually
there are <em>some</em> reasosn for a believe to form beyond the pure
willing of it. But even with that considered, there is undeniably a
choice involved in swinging the credence one way rather that
another.</p>
<p>In conclusion, beliefs are influenced by a combination of factors
some of which are chosen and some of which are not. There can often be
many more non-chosen factors than are recognized by the chooser, but
undeniably there <em>can</em> still be choice involved.</p>
