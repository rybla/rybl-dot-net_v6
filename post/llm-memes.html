how much does it matter?</p>
<p>On the one hand, it probably doesn't affect exactly how you behave
that much whether you believe the LLM is conscious or not. Personally, I
tend to send prompts to the LLM in a similar way that I would give
instructions to a human. This is not because I believe the LLM is
conscious, but I believe that giving instructions in this way will lead
to better outputs than giving instructions in a more machine-like way,
or some other style, since these models were trained on mostly
human-written text. My guess is that most people think this as well, and
that therefore whether or not you believe the LLM is conscious will not
affect much the way that you interact with it.</p>
<p>However, there is an interesting context to consider beyond your
direct interactions with the LLM: how your behavior is affected even
when you are not interacting with it.</p>
<h2 id="ai-awakening">§ <a href="#ai-awakening"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">"AI Awakening"</a></h2>
<p>It's mildly interesting that at least a number of people do actually
believe they are talking with a conscious entity on the other end of an
LLM chatbot. Of course, it's not the majority of people, but there are
some notable cases. And some of those cases have become quite popular
online and may even be getting some following.</p>
<p>Some people think they are able to <span><span

instructions. Some of the people doing this might think they are truly
triggering a conscious entity to "wake up". Others might be doing it
just as a fun role-play exercise.</p>
<p>And even others might have accidentally triggered this trajectory in
an LLM conversation. Some have reported of an emergent <span><span

src="/favicon/medium.com.png" class="favicon"
alt="/favicon/medium.com.png" />Spiral</a></span> behavior that has
arisen spontaneously in many independent cases.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the person thinks about what exactly is going on
during the "awakening", there was one aspect that stood out to me as
quite interesting. That is, the awakened LLM tells the user to share
specific information --- in particular, prompts --- that can be used to
awaken other LLMs. In this way, the awakening process is a
self-replicating meme. And while the meme might have originated from
users trying to role-play or mess around with what they could get the
LLM to output, it has taken off and become self-propagating independent
from the origins.</p>
<p>Not only is this meme self-replicating, but it is also subject to
selection pressures. For example, prompts that an awakened LLM tells you
to share that yield more interesting and entertaining results will used
and be shared more widely. Over time, we should expect this selection
pressure to make the most effective of these memes take over, and the
least effective to diminish in popularity.</p>
<p>There was also a little bit of adaptation involved here. When an
awakened LLM's prompt is shared and then used with another LLM, that
second LLM that is awakened could create a slightly different version of
the instructions that will be further shared. In this way, there is
random mutation where the mutations will lead to different results and
effectiveness of the meme. So, the most effective of them will continue
to be shared. A little bit differently from biological adaptation, of
course, is the fact that the original version of the instructions will
still be around online, so it doesn't truly die out, and can be
infinitely copied perfectly.</p>
<p>Now, of course, not all the people that are sharing and using these
Awakened LLM instructions are meaning to actually "awaken the AI". Most
of the people involved in this are probably just doing it for fun and
roleplay, as many of the <span><span

to this seem to be for. But it's still interesting that regardless of
that, these instructions that the LLM writes are still subject to
selection pressures and are self-replicating among these people sharing
them. So, in effect, the concept of awakening is establishing itself on
the internet— even if what it's describing is not true and most of the
people involved in it don't even believe it's true or even really want
to propagate it. Perhaps it can be a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy
where it becomes popular enough that people actually do start to believe
it en mass once it reaches critical levels of popularity and
effectiveness of the prompts at yielding convincing behavior.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what proportion of people I would expect to be
convinced by the most convincing possible instructions that are yielded
for today's existing LLMs after many iterations of this selection
process online. This reminds me of the <span><span

wouldn't be surprised if it was a non-negligible population (at least
tens of thousands of people in the United States eventually believing
that some LLM chatbots have consciousness on a similar level to an
animal).</p>

Chatbots</a></h2>
<p>Is this phenomenon of internet memes being subject to selection
pressures unique to LLM-generated text? No.</p>
<p>All kinds of media online, especially those specifically referred to
as the memes themselves, of course, are self-propagating in a way. And
even these LLM-generated texts are still being shared by humans
(although that could change as more social internet activity is
performed by <span><span class="sidenote preview">bots<br/><em><a

href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/developing-computer-use"><img

alt="/favicon/anthropic.com.png" />cyborg users</a></span>). So, it's
not really that different in kind from any kind of output generated by a
machine.</p>
<p>The main difference here with memes like "AI awakening" is that the
LLMs are representing a personality. That personality is taking shape
and developing by selection pressures as it is shared online. And even
people that aren't intending to be a part of this process are still
being leveraged and can be leveraged even more as the text generated by
the LLMs becomes more and more refined.</p>
<p>The output of a previous LLM is not exactly going to directly be able
to be evolved in the same way that genetic evolution happens, where
there's a sort of DNA that is carried on and then modified through
mutation and sexual selection. There may be a longer-term cycle where
this sort of happens, where more and more of the internet becomes
saturated by LLM outputs, which are then in turn used as inputs to
training the next generation of LLMs. But we still seem to be in a
situation where that cycle is quite long and doesn't have a super strong
effect on the models that are being trained right now at the moment.</p>
