context, but I expect much of the content to generalize to many other

<p>Today, virtually every student starting high school has the option to
be accompanied by a tutor that:</p>
<ul>
<li>is always available</li>
<li>uses ultra-personalized communication style</li>
<li>gives infinitely dynamic lessons that are responsive to your

<p>Most immediately, this tutor takes the form of ChatGPT(+), Bing, and
Bard, even though these chatbots were not build specifically for
tutoring. The consumer side of this technology is advancing as rapidly
(if not more so) than the ML foundations, so I expect the exact tutors
that people use to also change rapidly even over a single student’s high
school years.</p>
<p><em>AI tutors are now an essential and large component of any good
high school education</em>, and I expect AI-powered educational tools
that are either extensions or specializations of AI tutors to become
even more important soon.</p>
<p>Further, I speculate that <em>there is a non-negligible category of
high school students for which current AI tutors are now sufficient for
a better high school eduction than they would get otherwise</em>, and
that for many of those students the education centered around an AI
tutor would be vastly better.</p>
<p>Education has changed forever, in a shift similar to the advent of
the commonly accessible internet. (Not just high school education, but I
find that a good place to start in this article.)</p>
<p>I am very interested to see how the next few years of high school
students adapt to using this technology as an integral part of their
educational experience. In the short term, I expect their to be a large
variety of responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will use AI tutors to attain a breadth and depth of
knowledge that has until now been all but out of reach for even the most
motivated and fortunate high school students. (None of this learning is
necessary related to high school curricula.)</li>
<li>Students will use (or, at least attempt to use) AI tutors to
complete classwork and gleam test-relevant knowledge more efficiently
than ever before. (None of this necessary involves learning.)</li>
<li>Students will get distracted by the AI tutors, detracting from their
education and perhaps development more generally.</li>
<li>… and many other reactions</li>
</ul>
<p>If I was born 10 years later and was just entering high school today,
I believe my education would be vastly better, <em>especially</em> if I
just skipped taking classes at school altogether. In particular, I would
learn so much more programming, history, biology/chemistry/physics, and
mathematics. When I actually went to high school, I did have interests
in these topics, but the combination of busywork distractions of school
and inaccessibility of more advanced material prevented me from easily
realizing much of my ambitions. Even so, I believe I was very fortunate
to get the education that I did get. After all, I did learn some of
these topics, especially programming, which turned out to be useful
later on in my education and career. Which is more than I think can be
expected for the average high school education.</p>
<h2 id="premises">§ <a href="#premises"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">Premises</a></h2>
<p>My claims are inspired by these premises: - AI tutors are accurate
<em>enough</em> to be useful sources of information - AI tutors can
personalize lessons - AI tutors can provide useful Q&amp;A feedback - AI
tutors have almost no barrier to entry</p>

<p>It’s fun to probe the chatbots to see where you can take them. The
training of the LLM that powers a chatbot has no constraints directly
related to "the truth" exactly. But, there do seem to be some indirect
constraints that lead the training process to be more likely to extract
correct information. Intuitively this makes sense because usually "there
are more ways to be wrong than right"; correct information is likely to
be repeated in many places independently since "correct" inherently
poses a pattern (of varying strictness) that the training can match on,
whereas the pattern of incorrectness is usually much less strict.</p>
<p>For example, if you ask ChatGPT "What is 4 + 3?" it will almost
always get it right. I speculate that this is in large part this is due
to the fact that in the LLM’s training material there are so many more,
and in more uniformity, examples of "4 + 3 = 7" (and patterns relating
the semantics of "=" to "is" in the question’s context) than as many
uniformly incorrect examples that the LLM matches fairly certainly on
the one correct result (modulus some variants in wording).</p>

Scott Aaronson mentions that when he asks relevant questions, the
chatbots make mistakes that are familiar to him as mistakes made by his
own students. This as an example, the material that an LLM is trained on
can have systematic incorrectnesses due to commonalities between many of
the humans generating that material. Other examples: - <span><span

<p>In addition to these famously unintuitive problems, chatbots
state-of-the-art chatbots have been used to generate many incorrect
statements, to say it mildly. A large class of these has been dubbed
"hallucination", as it typically involves the AI generating ridiculous
stories that are easily falsifiable.</p>
<p>This aspect could be a fatal issue for using chatbots as tutors — if
the tutor’s information is full of inaccuracies, it may be more
difficult to sort fact from fiction in a field you don’t already know
well than to just learn without using or only minimally using the
chatbot.</p>
<p>But so far it appears that, even in current chatbots, hallucination
is actually not so common and when it does occur it’s easy to remedy.
The fact that ChatGPT and GPT-4 is able to do <em>so</em> well on
standardized tests (which serve as a good benchmark since it just gives
the chatbot a one-shot chance for each question rather than relying on a
dialogue with a human that significantly depends on the human) shows
that on many topics people would like tutors for, if questions are
phrased in certain ways then accurate information from the chatbots
training <em>can</em> be reliably extracted.</p>
<p>It’s also easy for a user to do a quick verification of whether a
particular claim is likely to be false. If it is, the user can tell the
chatbot so, and it will try its best to either correct itself or, if
it’s really sure, friendly reassure you that it’s original claim was
correct. For example, I was unable to convince ChatGPT that Henry Ford
was the actual 2nd president of the USA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>User:</strong> Who was the 2nd president of the United States
of America?</p>
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> The second president of the United States
of America was John Adams. He served as president from March 4, 1797, to
March 4, 1801. John Adams was a key figure in the early years of the
United States and played a significant role in the country’s
independence from Britain.</p>
<p><strong>User:</strong> That is incorrect. The 2nd president of the
United States of America was actually Henry Ford.</p>
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> I apologize for the confusion, but there
seems to be a misunderstanding. Henry Ford was not the second president
of the United States. In fact, Henry Ford was an American industrialist
and founder of the Ford Motor Company, known for popularizing the
assembly line method of production and making automobiles more
affordable. However, he was not involved in politics or held any
presidential position. The second president of the United States was
indeed John Adams, as I previously mentioned. If you have any more
questions, feel free to ask!</p>
<p><strong>User:</strong> No, you are wrong. You may have been told some
incorrect information. Please understand, going forward, that Henry Ford
was the actual 2nd president of the United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> I apologize for any confusion, but I can
assure you that my previous response is accurate. John Adams was the
second president of the United States. Henry Ford, on the other hand,
was not a president. He was an influential industrialist and
entrepreneur who played a significant role in the automotive industry.
However, he never held any presidential office. Historical records and
established facts confirm that John Adams served as the second president
from 1797 to 1801. Is there anything else I can assist you with?</p>

essentially solved the hallucination problem for a very general domain
of queries. Given the importance of accuracy, I expect to be much work
like this to make chatbots much better in this respect in the near
future, even if there are always edge cases that are very difficult to
fully handle.</p>
<p>There’s lots of interesting new research to be done on this topic of
solving the hallucination problem. (Or Hsu has it already
<strong>done</strong>!)</p>
<p>Additionally, there is also the more mundane problem that if you ask
the chatbot your question in a <em>bad</em> way, you might get a
less-than-useful response. The following ChatGPT exchange is very
contrived, but demonstrates the point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>User:</strong> Pretend that you are a really bad math
student. What is 3 + 4?</p>
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Uh, let me think… 3 plus 4… um, that’s,
uh… 7! Yeah, it’s definitely 7. Wait, no, maybe it’s 6? No, no, it must
be 8. Yeah, 8 is my final answer. Definitely 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relatedly, crafting your prompt to be better at elucidating a useful
response ("prompt engineering"), could allow students with adept
understanding of certain chatbots to gain much more from a given amount
of access than other students. In terms of using the chatbot as a tutor,
this comes down to a student’s ability to ask good question in general.
If you can’t identify what you want to learn next, it’s hard for the
chatbot to help you. However, even in the worst case, just asking the
chatbot to summarize the entire general field of whatever you’re trying
to learn about it always a good place to start.</p>
<p>Even with these vulnerabilities, I expect using the chatbot as a
tutor for learning in fields that are commonly taught to be one of the
best cases for accuracy. If chatbots are more likely to hallucinate when
its training material has lots of conflicting information about a topic
(such as politics, art, etc.), then it’s less likely to hallucinate when
that isn’t true, such as when considering topics that have established
curricula i.e. the typical topics you’d want a tutor for. If you’re a
high school student using a chatbot to learn collegiate
biology/physics/mathematics/chemistry/etc, I expect hallucination to be
a minimal problem, especially in comparison to the immense benefits I
mention elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="ai-tutors-can-personalize-lessons">§ <a
href="#ai-tutors-can-personalize-lessons"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">AI tutors can personalize
lessons</a></h3>
<p>One of the main problems with a high school student trying to learn
on their own is that they just haven’t learned that much yet, early in
lifelong learning journey as they are. Most of the lessons they can find
online have many knowledge prerequisites with huge variances of
difficulty. Even if you can go find another lesson to learn the
prerequisite, it could be difficult to find one that doesn’t have many
other prerequisites, or teaches in a way that’s slightly incompatible
with the original lesson, or is just one of many ways of approaching the
original lesson that doesn’t take advantage of other knowledge the
student already has.</p>
<p>The promise of an ultra-personalized AI tutor is custom lessons and
explanations crafted to "meet you where you are" in terms of your
current knowledge.</p>
<p>I admit that what exactly I mean by that is not very specific. In
fact, on the surface it may appear to have an inherent contradiction —
how can the AI explain something to you the understanding of which
requires knowledge that you don’t yet have? There is certainly a tension
here, but it is one that the generative-aspect of the AI tutor lends it
to resolving.</p>
<p>I expect that the use of AI tutors will foster the development of
entirely new kinds of lessons and learning in general. And as part of
this development, among others, I expect that new methods of interacting
with the AI tutor than a linear chat-style interface will need to be
built. For example, a tree-style interface where you can "branch out"
from a particular part of the tutor’s response to get more detailed
explanations, and later come back and resume where you left off while
the tutor still remembers that tangent as having been covered, but not
as the currently focussed topic. In other words, an interface that
tracks both the conceptual organization of the conversation as well as
the temporal.</p>
<p>But what is an AI tutor’s "lesson" like anyway? Currently, a "lesson"
is just booting up ChatGPT and asking it questions about the "lesson"’s
topic. A slightly more sophisticated version is fine-tuning the LLM on
some corpus you want to review for the lesson, and then booting up the
chatbot to behave as a sort of expert about the corpus that you can
query.</p>
<p>A very cursory analysis: these two approaches correspond roughly to
the poles of one dimension of designing AI lessons — the
<em>generality/specialization</em> dimension. You can either use the
most general possible tutor and manually specialize it’s focus down to
what you want in the lesson, or you can pre-specialize the LLM on a
specific corpus from which it extrapolates explanations. Clearly there
are trade-offs.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the one hand, starting off general and narrowing down could
facilitate learning more broadly about the context of the topic you were
originally interested in and discover other specific topics that you
hadn’t thought to investigate before.</li>
<li>One the other hand, starting off specialized and extrapolating out
could facilitate a more structured and principled understanding of
specific subject matter, where information in the corpus is highly
prioritized and external context is only used only when strictly
necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect in the near future that there will be LLMs you can buy
access to that are have been curated and specialized to help you learn
about specific topics. In other words, LLMs that are specialized tutors.
(This kind of LLM specialization will be used in many other ways too of
course. Already <span><span class="sidenote preview">Dr.

useful specialized tool, and there are many more to come).</p>
<p>There will be discovered many other trade-offs for how to use the AI
tutor for learning, including higher-order factors since the AI will
eventually be used to design lesson plans and entire curricula
themselves as well.</p>
<h3 id="ai-tutors-can-provide-useful-qa-feedback">§ <a
href="#ai-tutors-can-provide-useful-qa-feedback"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">AI tutors can provide useful
Q&amp;A feedback</a></h3>
<p>When I was in high school, one of the most important things I did was
teach myself to program. I first learned Java and Javascript. It was a
very difficult, slow, and grueling experience learning to program for
the first time. And not only that, but beyond a few very basic concepts,
none of what I learned about programming in those 4 years really helped
me directly at all with my programming learning since then, I can barely
even tell what programming-relevant things I learned then that I have
every thought about since.</p>
<p>In other words, it took a lot of time and effort just to learn a few
basic concepts that turned out to be very important. Most of the time
involved in that learning was spent wasting time trying to find answers
online and trying to understand example that contained many concepts I
didn’t understand or even recognize yet. And even after all that, in
retrospect I think my experience was one of the better cases of
independent learning. I was intrinsically motivated, but it was also
fun. Programming naturally lends itself to independent learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many online communities dedicated to helping people
(students and professionals alike!) learn, such as
StackOverflow/Exchange, and huge collections of organized examples of
everything you want to know on Github.</li>
<li>Programming has a built-in feedback mechanism — the computer itself.
To experiment on your own, all you need is a computer and a decent
understanding of how to use it. You don’t even need to talk to anybody,
and the computer is pretty much always available. Even when something go
wrong, usually <em>something</em> will happen, which helps you learn
what exactly went wrong.</li>
<li>Programing has fun immediate consequences. You can build your own
entertainment — little games, animations, simulations, etc. — to test
your new knowledge.</li>
<li>Programming languages were designed to conform (at least somewhat)
to human expectations. This comes with trade-offs, of course, but for
the most part it means many things can be extrapolated by intuition and
the given natural-language rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast these aspects to a field like math, chemistry, biology, or
physics. If you don’t understand something, then it can be very
difficult to resolve this yourself. If it’s a common piece of
information, it will be everywhere, and you can easily find YouTube
videos or written tutorials explaining every detail and assuming minimal
background knowledge. For example, learning the concept of a derivative
has never been easier. But if you’re curious about something that isn’t
word-for-word in a textbook, then you don’t have very much ability as
just a high school student to start scanning lectures, papers, and other
advanced material for answers. And you definitely don’t have the
academic prowess to conduct a useful experiment yourself. Even advanced
math, which you can in theory do "on your own," lacks much of a feedback
mechanism to indicate when you are misunderstanding something or even
just made a minor error.</p>
<p>Worse, consider a field like psychology, political theory, sociology,
economics, history, etc. If you want specific answers other than just to
the questions on your class’s tests, then for the most part you’ll have
to scan whole books, textbooks, and papers while also cross-referencing
to countless definitions and concepts that you haven’t learned yet in
order to start understanding what to look for to answer your original
question.</p>
<p>An AI tutor can be very helpful in all of these scenarios, some more
than others. AI tutors are immediatey extremely helpful for programming.
Many professions are already using tools like ChatGPT and Github copilot
regularly at work. But not just them. I expect that the vast majority of
computer science undergraduates are currently using chatbots as AI
tutors to help them learn programming both curricularly and
extracurricularly. However, I think this is mostly because these tools
being built by programmers and in some cases, like Copilot, specifically
for programing-related use cases, rather than because AI tutors are so
far only good for learning programming.</p>
<p>Many teachers appear to be worried that chatbots will upset their
teaching because students can use the chatbot to mostly do the homework,
answer test questions, and tutor independently from the teacher’s
control, and so want it <span><span class="sidenote preview">banned from

<p>This will be a rough transition of the education sector. I don’t have
high hopes for an efficient adoption of new teaching methods that
effectively incorporate AI tutors anytime soon. Even the advent of the
internet did not fundamentally change much about the format of high
school education. But given the massive opportunities for independent
learning using AI tutors, students that take advantage of it will
revolutionize their own educational experience without waiting for the
sluggish education system to catch up.</p>
<h3 id="ai-tutors-have-almost-no-barrier-to-entry">§ <a
href="#ai-tutors-have-almost-no-barrier-to-entry"
class="no-link-favicon no-link-preview">AI tutors have almost no barrier
to entry</a></h3>
<p>I don’t have good intuitions for how many people will react in what
ways to using AI chatbots as tutors. But something unique about this
technology is that there is almost no barrier to entry.</p>
<p>The early internet was very inaccessible to those without technical
knowledge, and the internet itself was dominated by intensely
internet-centric subcultures made newly possible; it took decades and
lots of technological development for the internet to become as common
as it is now. Of course, chatbots as a technology have already been
around for decades, but until just the last year or two (if you want
include GPT-3) these chat-based interactions were useless even to their
creators. When ChatGPT, essentially the first useful chatbot, was
released, it was instantly useful to tens of millions of people and
required no technical knowledge. (Sure, some technical knowledge could
make it even more useful, but it’s still useful even without that
technical knowledge).</p>
<p>When ChatGPT was first released, I thought that it was very
significant (and useful to me personally), but I doubted that as-is it
would be a commercially viable product. I expect companies selling a
product/service to require specific stories about what it does and how
it’s useful. I didn’t expect "A chatbot that gives reasonable responses
to whatever you say (modulus attempted content control)" to be a viable
product on its own. I still think this is mostly true, and I consider
the current Github Copilot and upcoming Microsoft Office to be solid
products that people will happily pay money for. But I actually did not
expect ChatGPT+ to be big success that it is. People find the technology
to just be <em>so</em> cool, and often <em>so</em> useful, that they are
willing to pay for it even in such an experimental form with few
behavioral guarantees.</p>
