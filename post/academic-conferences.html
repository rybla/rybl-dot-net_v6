<p>Academic conferences are large formal gatherings where researchers in
a particular field share their refereed results in the form of talks and
workshops. What are the goals of such conferences, and how well do they
achieve them in practice?</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I recently attended POPL 2022 in Philadelphia, which is an academic
conference on the <em>principles of programming languages</em> -- in my
field of research as a PhD student. This was the first academic
conference I attended in person (I have attended several online
conferences previously), and from my experience there I have refined
many ideas I've been developing about the purpose and effectiveness of
conferences.</p>
<p>One reason this experience was unique was that it was a hybrid
conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic -- that is, the conference was
hosted with full online support in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>every talk was facilitated with a live video feed streamed to online
participants</li>
<li>the stream was equipped with live transcription (very high
quality)</li>
<li>the majority of talks were given by online speakers</li>
<li>online participants could ask questions during talks</li>
</ul>
<p>But for physical participants, everything was conducted pretty much
as normal except for the mandatory mask-wearing at all times of
course.</p>
<h1 id="ideals">Ideals</h1>
<p>The main goals of a conference, it appears to me, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide a research for researchers to perform their results as
broadly-consumable talks</li>
<li>curate a selection of results to present to researchers in related
fields that they wouldn't have easily found normally</li>
<li>host workshops where senior researchers pass on wisdom to junior
researchers</li>
<li>gather researchers from many different institutions so they can make
connections and exchange developing ideas</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="realities">Realities</h1>
<p>How do real conferences live up to these ideals?</p>
<h2 id="online-conferences">Online Conferences</h2>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all academic conferences were
converted to online events, and only recently have they started to be
hosted in a hybrid model like POPL 2022 that I attended physically. This
provided a unique opportunity to see how much of the "conference
experience" could be translated into an online and often asynchronous
experience when it was forced to.</p>
<p>Online conferences have exactly 1 worthwhile feature, which is
providing the opportunity to ask speakers questions right after they
give their talk (though, often the talk itself was pre-recorded). But
even this feature is not very good, because most times the audience
doesn't have any good questions to ask, and then they are pressured to
come up with sub-par questions to ask just to show respect to the
speaker.</p>
<p>Other than this 1 feature, online conferences provide pretty much
nothing else worthwhile in terms of a conference experience, these
non-worthwhile features being:</p>
<ul>
<li>talks. If you don't make use of the Q&amp;A section after the talk,
this is a strictly worse experience than just watching the recorded talk
later, since the recorded talk can be watched at any time, paused, and
with modified playback-speed.</li>
<li>social events. It is very difficult to get that to work out well
with a large collection of strangers, or more likely a very small
collection of strangers because most people would rather spend time with
the people that are actually near them physically.</li>
<li>virtual "hallways". It's a cool idea, but apparently we don't have
the technology for this yet. VR chat work better. In practice, a virtual
hallway is just a list of people that are willing to chat with anyone
who wants to click on them. And not many people are interested in that.
A real conference hallway works by you wandering around until you hear
an interesting conversation or are introduced to someone by a mutual
connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I'm sure that on the backend there are still significances
to conferences that we unchanged by being hosted online, such as
financials and curating research results. But I'm not focussing on those
factors here.</p>
<p>What online conference attendees discovered was that the talks are
not a very important aspect of why they attend conferences. They are
more of a background ambiance for the hallways discussions and social
gatherings.</p>
