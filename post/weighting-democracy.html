<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In the United States of America, Democracy is viewed as an integral
to both the nation's identity and political system. However sympathies
to alternatives have always been present in the popular discourse as
well. Additionally, "Democracy" has gained so many political and moral
connotations that the distinction between it and a more accurate
description of our political process - as a democratic republic.</p>
<p>These observations inspire a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the concept of Democracy so important to the identity of the
USA?</li>
<li>What are the updsides and downsides to Democracy both in concept and
in practice?</li>
<li>How does Democracic practice in the USA compare to the ideal?</li>
</ul>
<p>This article attempts to answer the second question, while touching
contextually on the first and third. Additionally, this article is a
prompt for a discussion on an episode of the Art of Thought podcast.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: I use "Democracy" capitalized not to refer to the
Democratic political party in the USA, but to specifically refer to
"democracy" as popularly conceived in the USA.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-democracy">What is Democracy?</h1>
<p>This section serves as an overview of what Democracy means in this
article. There are many other resources that provide a more thorough
foundation, but that isn't necessary here.</p>
<p>So, what is democracy (lower-case)? According to dictionary.com,
democracy is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme
power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their
elected agents under a free electoral system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition serves as a landmark for considering Democracy, the
flavor of democracy as concieved of in the USA. Importantly, the phrase
"supreme power is vested in the people" regards every democratic
government's loyalty to the popular desicions of citizens when they are
submitted through the appropriate protocol.</p>
<p>Next, there are some important lines to draw between democracy and
Democracy.</p>
<p><em>Direct democracy</em> is democracy where <em>all</em> political
desicions, legislative and executive, are made through some kind of
popular vote among citizens. While this is commonly used in small
groups, it is not how the American government operates or even pretends
to operate at the national level.</p>
<p><em>Absolute democracy</em> is democracy where <em>all</em>
democratic desicions are executed regardless of conflicts with the
current law. The American national government contains a Supreme Court
that is appointed and can, in some circumstances, rule against
democractic desicions. The vast buerocracy that makes up the American
national and state governments ensures that many democratic desicions
are not faithfully executed as they are presented to the voting
citizenry. And finally, new democratic desicions cannot override the
American constitution unless the constitution is first ammeded to allow
it. For example, American citizens cannot be declared guilty of serious
crimes without the option for a preceeding trial by jury. So, the USA
does not practice absolute democracy.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: A democratic republic being a kind of democracy, I
take the republican side of this category to be an aspect of Democracy
in the USA.</p>
<h1 id="the-upsides-of-democracy">The Upsides of Democracy</h1>
<p>From a historical perspective, Democracy seems to have coincided with
the development of a hugely powerful and influencial country that is the
USA. The USA is currently a global superpower unmatched in almost every
aspect of international influence, and has been a top global superpower
for at least a century.</p>
<p>As for domestic concerns, Americans enjoy some of the highest living
standards ever experienced in any part of the world at any point in the
past. Of course, the USA is not alone in this status --- these luxurious
living standards are matched or surpassed in most of North America, most
of Europe, and much in North-Eastern Asia.</p>
<p>Much of the USA's political success is popularly attributed to its
faithful practice of Democracy. Some plausible upside of Democracy
are:</p>
<p><strong>U1. relative political stability</strong></p>
<p><strong>U2. political representation for citizens</strong></p>
<p><strong>U3. citizen participation in politics</strong></p>
<p><strong>U4. moderation of the concentration of political
power</strong></p>
<p><strong>U5. federated legislation executive power</strong></p>
<p><strong>U6. cohesion of national identity</strong></p>
<h1 id="the-downsides-of-democracy">The Downsides of Democracy</h1>
<p>Although Democracy is almost unanimously pronounced good by the
Americans both publically and privately, it is not without is downsides.
Notably, the history of democratic practice is littered with failures.
As Plato hypothesized (with ample evidence) in <em>Republic</em>,
democracies tend toward tyranny.</p>
<p>Democracy's central virtue is also is central vice. The public
citizenry, which can providing an anchorpoint for political moderation,
can also be swayed easily towards political mistakes. With the upsides
from the previous section in mind, some plausible downsides of Democracy
are:</p>
<p><strong>D1. unknowledgable voters involced many
desicions</strong></p>
<p><strong>D2. political incentive to appear good to voters rather than
perform well</strong></p>
<p><strong>D3. irrational views of citizenry when it comes to
policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>D4. greater popularity of the short-term over the
long-term</strong></p>
<p><strong>D5. slow processing for desicion-making</strong></p>
<p><strong>D6. distributed and vague responsibiltiy</strong></p>
