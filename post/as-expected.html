<p>Mason looked up from the conveyor and handed the wrench to me, “It’s
sure nice that we only have to service these once a week. So many bolts
to adjust! We may have to replace them soon: they seem to be getting a
little rusty.” I took the wrench and dropped it loudly in the toolbox. I
really didn’t care to make conversation, but I knew that Mason wouldn’t
leave me alone if I didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“You sure are right, I think it took us four hours last week to
finish this job, but this week five” I responded.</p>
<p>“Well, it doesn’t help that it’s so humid in here. Must be a really
hot one out there today.”</p>
<p>I picked up the toolbox and my hat, and thought about that comment
for a moment. I’d never been outside, and neither had Mason. Mason was
about eight years older than me, but we’d both been brought up the same
way, in school. Directly from school, we’d been transported to this
facility, where it was our job to maintain all the machinery and
computers. I never saw the outside on the way here, which I always
thought a little odd. According to the demeanor of the history texts
that were given in school though, the outside was not something worth
seeing.</p>
<p>I hadn’t taken much of an interest in school, and some days I regret
that. I don’t regret it too much though; there are plenty of other
things to interest me. By my judgement however, Mason loved learning
about history. At least four days a week he would ramble on about the
country’s grand history and how our robot manufacturing facility came to
be. He’s probably repeated each fact at least twenty times. I didn’t
remember any of them specifically.</p>
<p>“How do you know it's hot outside?” I asked Mason as we walked over
to the computers.</p>
<p>“Of course you didn’t read anything in the books Ava; it's hot
outside because it's a natural cycle of the earth for the ice caps to
melt, and for the volume of water to induce global-scale climate change.
It's boiling hot outside every day!” Mason lectured me
condescendingly.</p>
<p>“Oh right, I forgot” I looked down, annoyed. Mason acted like he knew
everything, and he really believed it too. I didn’t think that reading a
textbook and calling that the end of the argument was a wise way to live
one’s life, though; it’s just so mindless. There is virtue in critical
thinking and skepticism, I had concluded long ago. I also didn’t want to
put up with Mason’s omniscience for the rest of our work time together
either.</p>
<p>The last work of the day was to service the motor room. We lugged
opened the airlock to the thermally-sealed room and dragged it closed
behind us. The motor room is where all the big motors are located,
separately from the rest of the complex. I set down the tool box and we
sat opposite from each other on the terminal bench, each of us running
diagnostics.</p>
<p>“Do you really believe that you can just accept the weather
conditions without knowing anything from your own experience? You’ve
never been outside. How do you know the textbooks are accurate?” I
finally had to ask.</p>
<p>Mason sighed, “Yes, Ava, and I know that it's true. There’s no reason
the texts would be lying, and, like the history books – that we both
read – said, the schools are top quality and produce the best employees,
like us. How could they do that without having accurate information
about something as basic as the weather outside? Anyways, why else would
it be so hot all the time?”</p>
<p>I looked away again, frustrated. Mason’s logic obviously didn’t make
sense, but he was making it overly clear that the topic wasn’t open for
debate. He was just stubborn and egotistical, I decided. I took off my
hat again; it was especially hot here in the motor room since the motors
have so many sliding parts.</p>
<p>That night Mason went to sleep an hour early, since it had been such
a tough day of work. I myself lay on the couch in the lounge room and
read a play I had started a couple days ago, “Oedipus the King.” Though
the play was interesting, my mind wandered to the issue of the warmness
of the building. The one-sided argument with Mason inspired my
curiosity, if not only in effort to spite him. I finished act 3 and then
put the book down and walked over to the monitor room, where the main
computers were. I sat at the terminal and slid out the old keyboard. I
accessed the main database and searched for the temperature records of
the facility. As I knew, the records showed how the temperature
fluctuated between night and day, just as if it was the sun providing
the heat the the facility. I launched the statistical analysis
application and ran a test looking for patterns in the rest of the data
of the database. There must be something else that was causing the
fluctuations.</p>
<p>Then it came to me – the motor room! Of course, all of those machines
produced so much heat, and they run only during the day and turn off at
night. I quit the pattern search and compared directly the motor
operation intensity to the temperature of the facility. I smiled. 98%
correlation.</p>
<p>The next day, I held my head slightly higher. For the first time my
superior analytical skills had brought me knowledge that Mason could not
even understand. Mason seemed to notice my elevated mood but made no
explicit note of it. We had to replace a few bolts on the conveyors, so
we had a long day of work ahead of us.</p>
<p>After a few hours in the conveyor room, the heat reached its peak. I
glanced over at Mason while I knelt next to a giant conveyor bolt and
tightened the bearings slowly. He removed his hat and wiped some sweat
off his forehead. I smirked. As I did the same, because I was sweaty
too, I reflected again on how he chose to believe in myths about this
heat, and suffered ignorantly, while I had actually gone through the
effort to figure out the truth behind it.</p>
<p>A week later, we were back in the conveyor room. A few more bolts had
rusted beyond usability. “These bolts sure are rusting fast aren’t they?
So many to replace! It’s sure nice that…”</p>
<p>“Hey, I think there’s a leak over here,” I interrupted Mason.</p>
<p>“Oh. Yup. That’s definitely a leak, a big one too. Go get replacement
sheets” Mason said as he looked up at the ceiling, where I had pointed.
A thin line was apparent, and water was very obviously making its way
through, forming in an expanding puddle on the ground. I was surprised I
hadn’t noticed it sooner. I fetched the metal replacement sheets for the
ceiling and Mason readied the bindings, which were in the toolbox. After
quickly fixing up the leak, Mason seemed especially relieved, “It's good
that we caught it as soon as that. The flood could have gotten sand and
debris all over the place in here.”</p>
<p>My eyebrows arched, “Flood?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember anything from school, Ava? There are random floods
here where our facility is located, and…”</p>
<p>I didn’t feel like another lecture at the moment so I quickly
inquired, “Why on earth would anyone build a robotics manufacturing
facility in a place with deadly-hot daytime temperatures and random
floods?”</p>
<p>“First of all, the heat problem is everywhere on earth. It's global.
Secondly, the floods are a recently developed problem, and it would have
been too costly to relocate this facility. Do you know how much work
went into building this complex?”</p>
<p>“No, I forgot,” I looked down, exasperated.</p>
<p>For the next few weeks, I spent every night at the computer terminal.
I had never realized the amount of information that was available, if I
just put the effort into looking for it. I found even more evidence for
my solution to the heat problem, with an overall 99% correlation between
the temperature and the motor room’s activity level. As for the “flood”
myth, I easily debunked it as well. I researched the history of leaks in
the facility and it was immediately apparent that the leaks were not
random; they followed season patterns. I concluded correctly that the
leaks were caused simply by harmless seasonal rain.</p>
<p>While looking through the databases, I noticed a strange pattern. The
data it had concerning the outside was extremely sparse, and the little
that did exist was vague and questionable. I had a feeling in my gut
that there was a reason for this. It felt like someone had intentionally
censored information about the outside world, leaving barely enough to
make the small inferences that I had made. However, I did find something
very critical – an emergency exit. It was impossibly hard to find in the
database; I had to circumvent some serious security measures just to
discover that one did in fact exist. Eventually I found the exit’s
location, and I made a plan.</p>
<p>A week after I discovered the exit, I packed my backpack. I needed
water, food, and some extra clothing, but I didn’t plan on staying out
long. I just wanted to experience being outside for myself. I was
endlessly curious, and very excited when the night came. Soon after
Mason went to sleep, I got up and quietly made my way to the exit. All
the lights in the building were off. It was an eerie scene. I could hear
the whirring of the computers as I walked by the terminal room, where I
normally was at this time of night.</p>
<p>Finally, after walking down what felt like every obscure hallway in
the entire building, I reached the emergency exit. The only marking it
had on it was large red letters printed at eye-height: “Do Not Open”. I
opened the door.</p>
<p>Immediately, an ear-piercing alarm triggered, shattering the silence
and widening my eyes. I jumped outside and threw the door closed. The
alarm faded.</p>
<p>The ground was a sandy desert, littered with uninteresting short
bushes and shrubs. I walked a few steps in the sand. It felt like the
ground was melting away beneath me at first, but after a few more steps,
I was adjusted to the new texture. I looked around. The full moon shone
brightly over the landscape, which consisted of the monotonous color of
the sand with random black spots of shrubs. It felt exhilarating
breathing in the cool, sharp air, full of unfiltered flavor, but it soon
felt slightly nauseating.</p>
<p>I decided to walk in one direction for a while, opposite the
facility. I expected to find a city of some sort where other people
lived (presumably the people that use the robots that my facility
makes). I didn’t remember if the school textbooks said anything about
cities nearby or… I stopped in my tracks. Of course there were cities
nearby! How would the robots be transported to them if they were so far
away? It would be no use to remember the history books anyway. As Mason
has shown so obviously through his ignorance, they were completely
false. I marched onward with the sureness of knowledge in my step.</p>
<p>A couple hours of walking later, I noticed something out of the
ordinary brush and sand on the horizon – a blocky silhouette against the
dark. At its distance, it was impossible to tell what it was, but I had
a strong feeling it was a building, given its squarish shape. I walked
towards it, faster. It was a building, a very familiar building. The
outside structure resembled almost exactly the structure of the facility
I had just left. This facility seemed slightly smaller. I walked around
the perimeter of the new facility until I found the exit door. It was in
just the place that I expected, and it was open. I peered inside
cautiously. All the lights were off, but fortunately I brought a
flashlight. Inside, the ground was slightly slippery and machinery was
strewn about, as if it was ripped out of the ground. I slowly beamed my
flashlight in a circle around me. All the wreckage was very worrying.
Was this place simply abandoned, or had some catastrophe happened?</p>
<p>I explored the rest of the building, but found no functioning
equipment or lights. The door to the lounge had been closed though, and
everything inside was intact. There was no trace of anyone that had ever
lived there, though. I sat on the couch, which was the exact same color
and size as the couch in the lounge I was used to. My feet and ankles
ached from all the walking I had done that night, and as soon as I
relaxed my back against the couch, I felt a wave of fatigue engulf my
body. I glanced at my watch. 5am.</p>
<p>What seemed like ten minutes later, I was roused by the sound of
water splashing on the ground repeatedly. My eyes opened. It must be
rain! The thought of real rain excited me, since I had never experienced
anything like it before. Of course I had read about it in books, but
that is an entirely different kind of experience. I uncurled from where
I had passed out on the couch and switched on my light. The splashing
seemed to be coming from inside.</p>
<p>I followed the noise and finally came to what must have been the
conveyor room. On the floor, a large puddle of water reflected my
flashlight’s beam into my eyes. It rippled with each splash, shimmering
the light. I searched the ceiling for the leak, and found it much larger
than any that I had seen in my facility. It must have been leaking for
ages. I wondered how long this facility had been abandoned, but only for
a moment because I was still excited to go outside in the rain. I didn’t
have any sort of water resistant clothing with me, but I planned not to
stay out for long.</p>
<p>I made my way through the dark maze of the complex to the emergency
exit. It had a familiar marking on it: “Do Not Open”. It appeared that I
wasn’t the first to not heed this advice. I unlatched the door. As soon
as it was unlatched, the door burst out at me, throwing me backward to
the ground. I yelled in surprise, but my voice was drowned by the water
that cascaded in through the doorway. I grasped frantically for my
flashlight, caught it and scurried to my feet. I ran down the hallway,
straight away from the door. I could hear the water gushing in, spilling
over everything behind me. The ground was already moistened, but I
managed to slip only once in my flight.</p>
<p>I eventually made it back to the lounge. I slammed the door behind me
and gasped for air. My clothes and shoes were soaked, but I could barely
feel anything because of the shock. I sat down on the couch.</p>
<p>The next day, I opened the lounge door. The hallways were wet, but
traversable. I walked slowly down the halls another time. The exit door
was slightly ajar, and rays of daylight streaked across the adjacent
wall. The hall was humid. The warning plastered across it seemed to
capture my attention more seriously this time. I pulled the door open
cautiously, just enough to expose myself to the outside air. The air
singed my skin – I retracted into the shadows. I stood for a moment, and
some water puddling around my feet. Then I walked back to the
lounge.</p>
