<p><u>Abstract</u></p>
<p>A short story.</p>
</div>
<p><em>(this story contains no typos)</em></p>
<p>Lucy idly strode through the grove. The weather was overcast as
always, but the greenery and air felt like Spring. Madame, we must
return to the castle at once, said the heavily armored knight that was
trailing behind her.</p>
<p>"Why must we go now? So pleasant it is this morning," Lucy said
halfheartedly.</p>
<p>It is almost nightfall, and there are terrible beasts that roam about
after dark. Lucy glanced into a bush slightly off-path finding thousands
of large gristly eyes staring back at her from the shadows. Lucy
shuddered, then looked up to the evening sky for a few moments. With new
composure she continued walking through the grove.</p>
<p>The knight dashed in front of her, standing in her way with his arms
outstretched -- ready for an embrace or tackle. You must return now,
Madame! It is your sacred duty to the kingdom. Lucy shut her eyes and
shook her head annoyedly.</p>
<p>"There are worse beasts in that castle, you know," she muttered.</p>
<p>The knight looked at her. Yes. Yes there are. But they are beasts you
must serve for all our sakes. Madame, you are the only one left for whom
the sky opens! Lucy suddenly shoved the knight aside and bolted down the
wrong path. The knight glared after her as she disappeared into the
thickets, his eyes fading.</p>
<p>Lucy ran frantically by involuntary spasms in her legs. Eventually,
exhaustion took her, and she fell lopsidedly to the forest floor. The
dirt was soft and warm in the evening sun, and she began to roll
joyfully in its comfort. Her arms and legs sank naturally into the mud,
inducing a tingling sensation. She dipped forward and closed her eyes,
facing into the ground for a depth. Lucy fluttered her eyelids slightly,
but her head's clay encasing held her in a statis.</p>
<p>After what seemed like hours, she slowly regained her will and
finally rolled over onto her back, gasping for a moment. She opened her
eyes and found a familiar castle looming above her. Lucy wearily rose to
her feet and began to walk along the tall, stony, and cold wall of the
castle. She reached out her hand and scratched it across the wall’s
rough surface. Her fingernails traced an intricate fossil array with
which the wall was embossed; each giant stone was covered in colorful
spirals and spikes so small she could not focus on them directly.
Eventually the wall fell suddenly fell away -- she was at the
enterance.</p>
<p>Lucy timidly walked through the tall corridor. It was very dark in
the middle part of the entrance, and by the time she got to the other
end the only light left was from the moon. The streets of the castle’s
inner keep were empty, and all windows and doors to the neighborly
dwellings had been removed. She slowly walked the perimeter of the
castle, dreading with every moment what she must do that night.</p>
<p>After traversing the empty courtyard, Lucy had arrived at the inner
tower. She opened its small wooden door and shuffled inside. The
carpeted spiral steps seemed extended her vision around the winding
corner, and as she climed she felt treading in place, or even slipping
backwards. Her eyes were sleepy, her eyelids drooped, and a few times
times her eyelashes got stuck into her socket. Finally she made it to
the top floor. Looking out the tower window, she could see she was much
higher than the clouds and the castle grounds were dwarfed by a murky
nightscape stretching in every direction. In sharp contrast, the moon
hung in the empty black sky so huge and crisply detailed it was almost
within her reach.</p>
<p>Lucy's attention was drawn to a single figure standing across from
her atop the tower. The face was hard to discern as it loomed over. It
stepped toward her, standing in the center of the tower’s platform.
Lucy, are you there? If you can hear me, try to blink. Don’t move Lucy.
Lucy glared at the figure.</p>
<p>"Why do you want me here? Why must I blink?" Lucy asked of the
figure.</p>
<p>The figure said nothing in response -- instead it paced back and
forth between the parapets as a indistinguishable sound emitted.
Suddenly a gust of wind picked up, like a vacuum had erupted. The air
felt thinner, and colder, and harder. The moon swayed in the sky,
seemingly with the air current. Lucy stared in surprise as the figure
was roughly tumbled across the platform and right off the edge. Then she
snapped down to held on to the wooden boards, short of breath. The moon
rocked closer on a pendulumnal trajectory with the tower. She crawled
desperately towards the downward stairs, squinting through the
turbulence of the next handhold. Her direction felt vertical. And her
grip was weak, and the vacuum was too strong.</p>
<p>Lucy lost grip, scraped herself along the planked platform, and
ricocheted between parapets. She felt her battered, weightless form
plummetting, and above she saw the moon finally hit the tower.
Brightness sparked with a supersolar luminance. Even through her winced
eyelids her eyes were seared. She thought to lift her arms, but they
were strengthless after being torn away.</p>
<p>The ground arrived suprisingly suddenly. An incredible weight
strapping her to a deep indentation where she landed, as if a powerful
magnet held her. The remains of her body were a brittle metallic
material, with a flexibility only revealed under intense heat. She lay
still and dared not open her eyes.</p>
<p>A gigantic obelisk erupted next to her with a voice booming
incomprehensibly. Lucy desperately writhed in the sunken earth to get
free, but every turn drew her deeper into the surface. Lucy! Grab her
leg!</p>
<p>The clouds suddenly parted with a flashing, scorching rainbow boring
through. The light was brighter than the Moon's explosion; the shining
permeated her senses so directly that everything she had ever seen were
merely diffusions in retrospect. Lucy writhed, trying to focus on
anything but the light. Someone was talking. Or yelling?</p>
<p>The space beyond the clouds gradually split into colored shards of
infinitely detailed jaggedness. As they settled more distinctly, Lucy
could see that the shards were pushed by a celestial current -- they
flowed fluidly around the skyscape in unpredictable but seemingly
natural patterns.</p>
<p>Mustered all of her strength in a final effort to lift her left arm,
she did. It angled out to her side in an abrupt spurt. The back of her
hand hit the smooth, cold surface of the giant obelisk next to her. It
felt hard and metallic on the back of her hand, but in hitting it she
could sense a sort of lively recoil. Like some sort of machine it was
rumbling slightly.</p>
<p>The shards continued to dance in the sky more and more prominently,
and the clouds stopped moving. Lucy tried to find some sort of grip on
the obelisk — something, anything, to hold on to. She could feel her
mind racing, but her heart felt like it had stopped. She wondered if she
had sunk to the bottom of a lake and was drowning. She blinked several
times, then concentrated on her skin to tell if it was wet. After a few
moments of considering her sensations, she determined that she was not
wet, and likely not drowning.</p>
<p>Lucy noticed that the small crater in the ground she had made had
started to feel more comfortable. A warm sensation developed in her arm,
and then it traveled up to her shoulders, and down her back. Lucy’s neck
relaxed slightly.</p>
<p>The shards in the sky slowly began to fade more and more into
obscurity, and the light’s intensity faded. The clouds moved slightly to
cover up the hole, but still left a large oval opening by the time they
were still again. Lucy took several deep breaths, absentmindedly patting
the spirited obelisk. But, between pats, it precipitously
disappeared.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Lucy turned her head to inspect the obelisk. There was
nothing, but she realized her head could turn again. She lifted her
other arm carefully out of the small crater. The movement felt bulky and
awkward, but still possible.</p>
<p>Lucy rolled effortfully onto her side, out of the crater at last. She
dared to glance upward, and saw that there were still precise shards
swirling around in the oval cloud-hole. Though not nearly as blinding as
before. She finally arose to her feet and looked around. None of the
buildings appeared to be damaged, and there wasn’t even any sign of
obelisk that had been right next to her. She peered up at the tower,
where she saw that in place of the highest part where she had been was a
ruined stump, but it was difficult to see where the debris had gone.</p>
<p>Once she regained her composure, Lucy began walking away from the
castle as briskly as she could, which was not so much as her body felt
oblong and heavy somehow. After only a few minutes of lumbering along,
she was greeted again by the dreaded knight, which she could no longer
escape. Oh madame, it is a misfortune you fell off the tower. But you
have served your kingdom well, and every one of us pledges dedication to
your Highness. The knight kneeled alone.</p>
<p>"At least I am done with it, though I am still recovering. I have
also decided I’m leaving, and I do not know when I shall return," said
Lucy.</p>
<p>The knight looked up solemnly. A priest walked by. The whole
kingdom’s citizenry thanks you, your Highness. The sky is Opened! The
Endless Darkness is banished! exclaimed the priest. Let us all
rejoice!</p>
<p>Lucy turned back to her knight, "I can't do it again, the next
time."</p>
<p>The knight took a concerned look for a moment, then resolved. You do
need some time away, Madame. But do not worry yourself, I have consulted
the astronomers and they say the sky has many months before re-opening,
said Lucy’s knight. In the meantime, your leave has been arranged. There
is an outpost at seven-day’s travel out of the Se where you can stay. We
have trained a interim Queen to subsume your national duties.</p>
<p>"You knew I wanted to leave?"</p>
<p>Lucy’s knight glanced up at the tower. No, Madame.</p>
<p>Lucy started her journey the next day. A pair of servants traveled
with her on horseback to help carry supplies. Even though her body was
still lethargic, the powerful movement of her mount helped her forget.
During the days as they rode, Lucy avoided looking at the sky-hole. The
shards showed wildly different patterns every time. Sometimes there were
blacks and grays with intermittent flashings. Other times there were
greens and whites with barely any flowing at all.</p>
<p>During the nights, Lucy would lie on her back and stare straight into
the sky hole. The light was not painful anymore, but with no moon left,
the sky hole was an omnipresent shimmer in the dark, as if it was always
dawn. She found herself finding constellations in the shards, connecting
them to form animals, people, buildings. With all of the movement, it
was easy to impart agency to the shards as if they moved around and
interacted with other shards by their own will. The sky hole loomed
imposingly in her mind when she slept.</p>
<p>Arrival at the outpost began a cycle of perfect daily monotony. Each
morning, Lucy would sit on the small beach and perpendicularly look out
over the river for several hours. The servants and soldiers that
maintained the outpost would sometimes cross her view or talk about her
quietly in her periphery, but after a few days she ceased to notice.
During these hours Lucy developed a relaxing sense of unity with the
river’s current. When the thick water splashed over the river banks, she
could sense it right before it happened like it was connected to
something instinctual in her, or even influenced by her somehow.
Eventually Lucy would say she became nauseous with an advancing
headache, and so each evening she would retreat inside the outpost to
attend to any recent letters and any royal judicial duties.</p>
<p>In the remaining hours of the evening, Lucy sometimes would take out
a fresh piece of parchment to begin personal writings. For an hour or so
those evenings, she would write about whatever came to mind. Sometimes
it was a story about a younger version of herself growing up in a large
future city with cars and computers. Other times the writing felt so
relaxing that she found herself hours later with pages and pages of
scribbles in a pulse or wave pattern. One time the writing was of
something critically urgent, and she wrote desperately to not forget any
detail, but the next day she could not even discern the letters she had
written.</p>
<p>A few weeks after Lucy arrived at this outpost, she awoke one morning
to a pleasant sensation she thought she might never have again — the
heaviness that had burdened her since the sky opening had disappeared
entirely. Perhaps it had waned gradually and she hadn’t noticed, but
this morning was very evidently different. Lucy sat on the beach as
always, but this time basking in a new vitality. She barely noticed that
her incorporeality weakened her sense of unity with the river’s current
now, as if the river was trying to grasp on to her but her reception
kept slipping through its fingers. Your majesty, please let us have your
council, said a soldier waiting patiently behind Lucy. She took a few
moments to collect herself, then stood for the soldier. Walking across
the sand felt like floating. They walked to a large chamber where the
outpost’s officer was stationed.</p>
<p>We have received word from the kingdom that after four months'
retreat, you are due to return at once. We shall prepare a return party
for you to leave with in the morning. said the officer robotically. Lucy
nodded, then returned to her beach. As she crossed the the sand once
more, she noticed that the sky hole had shrunken substantially since her
the last time she had looked. The swirling shards were dim and
indistinct against a heavy gray background of the overcast stretching
indefinitely in all directions.</p>
<p>In the evening, Lucy felt compelled to write earlier than usual. She
shirked her regular duties and stared intently at a blank parchment.
Lucy stood, taking the parchment in one hand and her quill in the other.
Lucy wrote</p>
<p>"I won’t go back. I owe nothing to the Kingdom of Darkness. No, I am
a Bringer of Light, and I will establish my own rightful domain. Today,
I walk directly out of my room and straight into the forest.</p>
<p>A few servants stare at me confusedly as I walk into the night. I
continue walking. And walking. The forest is almost entirely dark, with
no moon and with such dim, ghastly shards. A few times I peered up to
see the Aperature obscured by a tree's silhouette, and the sky was
empty. I can’t avoid tripping over the gnarled roots and shrubs. I
continue walking. Walking feels effortless now — now that I am not
cursed with weightfulness. I can walk forever…</p>
<p>It was been several days and nights, I have found the end of the Se.
There is nothing of note here where it seeps into the crevices of the
ground except for the surprising viscosity of the warm mud.</p>
<p>I am not sure how long or far I have walked, but I have arrived in a
wasteland with a single tree. The tree is a marbled white with no leaves
and a trunk so tall that it stretches up further than I can see. I can
peel its surface with my fingernails, and the little bits have a unique
dirty texture when I grind it between my fingers…</p>
<p>Today was the last day. The skyhole is entirely gone, and with it all
the light in this world. I can still make out the black ink on this page
as I write it -- although mostly from touch rather than sight -- but I
have found any previous entries to now be indistinguishable from the
parchment. I have taken refuge here with my back to this tree, its bark
so white it still stands out in the lightlessness. A few times I have
attempted to climb it, only to find my arms have no strength. Only my
fingers are nimble enough to move with any control. I lay flat with my
hands on this page, and I worry that if I write too much more, I will
not be able to change to the next page. And besides, I would not dare
climb with the risk of dropping my quill and paper. If I lose them, I
shouldn't even find them again…</p>
<p>The ground below me feels different. It was certainly barren hard
when I first arrived, but now my legs are embedded in a soft, warm gel.
I haven't traveled further, have I? I loss sense of my legs long ago, so
maybe they traveled me unconsciously. Perhaps the Se is flooding, and I
just can't see it? My body feels slightly cold, so the gel is very
comforting. I will just lay in it now, to regain some warmth. I did not
know how truly cold I was. The sensation spreads up my legs and back and
down my arms and neck…</p>
