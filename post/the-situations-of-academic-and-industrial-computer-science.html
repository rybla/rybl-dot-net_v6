student). I also commonly read the formal and informal writing of many
academic and industry computer scientists.</p>
<p>Firstly, since computer science is a relatively new field, it is not
well specialized into different categories. Computer science, as it is
commonly used, includes a huge variety of entirely separate
subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software engineering</li>
<li>Cryptography (basically math)</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Type Theory (math but different)</li>
<li>Graphics</li>
</ul>
<p>You could argue that they all share a basis of making computers do
things with algorithms, but this is analogous to arguing that philosophy
and chemistry might as well be combined into one field because they both
share a basis describing the principles of observable phenomenon.</p>
<p>My point is that computer science is an extremely broad field, and
due to this it is difficult to develop useful generalizations about the
entire field.</p>
<p>That being said, here are some generalizations on the situations of
academic and industrial computer science. They are just my observations,
from my own experiences and from the arguments I’ve generally heard from
others, but is not deeply researched into the details of specific
subfields.</p>
<p>In fields like chemistry and physics, in which I have no special
knowledge, there are clear distinctions between the academic trajectory
and the industrial trajectory for a rising student/worker. In chemistry
you either prepare to be a chemical engineer, or you prepare for
chemistry research. In physics you either prepare to be some sort of
engineer or you become a theoretical physicist. I think there are
similar dynamics in other scientific fields, such as biology,
psychology, etc.</p>
<p>I don’t see this dynamic strongly in computer science; there is much
less distinction between the research-type work being done in academia
and industry. Academic computer scientist are still usually hardcore
programmers, and could easily pick up a software engineering job at any
time. In fact, often academic research involves programming projects.
Large software companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc.
employ many researchers from advanced positions in academia, and this is
not as a sort of degree requirement like going into medicine because
these researchers continue doing similar research in groups like Google
AI research groups of Amazon’s automated reasoning research groups.</p>
<p>However, there are still serious differences between the environments
of academia and industry, even in computer science.</p>
<p>In industry, goals are important and specific. An aphorism I heard at
Galois captures this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Industry contracts have hard requirements, but negotiable deadlines.
Government contracts have hard deadlines, but negotiable
requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d say that this dynamic is even more pronounced between industry
and academia, where academia works like the government but even more
layers removed from requirements evaluation (such as by the military,
which would be most of the government contracts taken by Galois). The
obvious reason is that the projects taken on in industry almost always
have a short-to-medium term product in mind. The product is usually
client-facing, but could also be for internal use. In any case, the
application for the project is almost always in mind <em>when</em> the
project is started, even if the ultimate revenue source is further
downstream. This sets up project developments for incremental evaluation
against specific goals by people external to the project and similar
projects. The largest industrial research groups may have long-term
plans to apply research that are less specific, but on average are still
much more specific than the average academic grant application.
Industrial computer scientists are primary evaluated on the usefulness
of applications of their research/work, and their ability to meet
predefined goals. Industrial researchers get hired to work on specific
research that the company already planned on undertaking.</p>
<p>In academia, goals are nebulous and based more on community interest
than practicality. Funding is dictated by (usually government-funded)
grants, which are awarded based on the community prestige of the
applicants, diversity initiatives, and writing quality of the grant
application. Grant applications are best when they promise as much as
possible within believability, addressing every aspect of the grant
description. If the grant is received, then there is very little
evaluation of how closely the funded research matches the grant
application, other than how many publications resulted that at least
fall within the description. Academic researchers are primarily
evaluated on the quantity of their publications weighed by the prestige
of the journals they were published in. Academic researchers are
primarily intrinsically motivated, by their interests and their own
views on practicality, and very rarely by applications of their work.
The significance of an academic’s work is almost entirely dependent upon
how interesting other researchers in their microfield deem it. And these
are very small communities — there aren’t very academics in total, and
most long-term academics are extremely specialized — I think this is
because long-term academics eventually get tenure (otherwise they would
probably leave academia) which guarantees them a job and so they never
need to worry about acquiring research knowledge in other subfields
because they don’t have to worry about a forced transition, and depth of
expertise is much more rewarded than breadth because research is always
focused on the very edge of current knowledge which tends to require
specialization in that direction.</p>
<p>So here’s a question: should the government focus more on funding
computer science research through academia (like it does currently) or
through industry (which it does to some extent but not as primarily as
academia)?</p>
<p>What works great in industry, as I’ve described, is when there are
specific goals. Academic researchers transition to industry exactly when
companies find reasons for that research to be done for use in some
application they can profit from. Sometimes, this will overlap with
something that’s already being done in academia. A primary example of
this is machine learning, which originated in academia but has since
found huge support in industry, as it has become very profitable to
develop for large companies like Google. The benefit to society of
industrial research is that the company creates value, which it is
partially compensated for in the form of profit, but the rest of which
is accessible to society. Sure, much research is proprietary, but its
turned out in the realm of modern computer science that the research
developments can be more useful to themselves open-sourced for many
reasons. This often results in companies publishing alongside academics
in journals. What the company keeps proprietary is computer capital
(computing power) and human capital (skilled programmers and
researchers).</p>
<p>But, as I described, there’s a lot of research in academia than has
very general goals and nebulous evaluation. This kind of
primarily-academic research does not have a product in mind. Of what
value is it then? In the ideal case, this can be the sort of basic
science research that benefits society in broad ways that are hard to
capture that value of by a company. As an example I’m familiar with, the
development of type theory was initiated a mathematical exercise to
address Russel’s paradox and encode mathematical propositions in
machine-checkable form. A half-century along, these abstract foundations
have found their way into many industrial-strength programming
languages, including Scala, Typescript, Rust, and (if you’re generous)
Haskell and OCaml. An extremely general argument for basic science
research is that it pays the activation cost for unpredictable projects
in the future that can’t be reliably pursued with profit in mind. A
small start-up that takes advantage of innovative new ideas would be
much less feasible if it first had to do all the basic research required
to get to the point of actually making something useful to profit off
from. I admit that it’s very difficult to support this argument, in a
similar way to how its very difficult to support funding pure
mathematics research. Sure, some of it will eventually be used to make
value, but it really seems like a huge amount of it is just academic
masturbation with no conceivable practical use ever.</p>
<p>In short, research that has a specific value-adding goal in mind is
definitely best done in industry, and basic science research is probably
best done in academia. But, there are a lot of serious problems with
academia, and I don’t see any good practical solutions. It seems to be
an inherent part of the academic style of research, where goals and
justifications are so nebulous, that primary motivations for research
become prestige within their micro-community, publishing pressure, and
securing tenure so they don’t have to worry about being evaluated any
more and just focus on what interests them. I think this style certainly
does do basic science research, but it’s so obviously inefficient and,
from the inside, feels really toxic to me. It almost feels corrupt,
especially since everything is funded almost entirely by the public.
Academics are so far removed from their source of sustenance and also so
far removed from those that would ever want to use their work to make
something that actually will get evaluated outside the community — its
extremely insular. In this way, academia exists as a sort of parallel
world divorced from the economic and social realities of the
non-academic. Some people love this, and I can empathize with the view.
That’s what interested me in theoretical computer science and going into
a PhD program — the focus on researching interesting ideas above all
else and not worrying about the often frustratingly manual process of
turning a good idea into a good product. But, since becoming a PhD
student, I quickly came to realize that sort of dynamic doesn’t result
in the kind of environment that I want to work in as a career. I haven’t
planned to drop out yet, but I easily would if I found a reasonable job
opportunity where I can do interesting work in industry.</p>
