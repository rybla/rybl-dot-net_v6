<p><u>Abstract</u></p>
<p>Staring at a tree for one year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The tree's shade finally inches over me. I chose this spot mostly
because of the tree, and its place standing tall at the top of the hill.
I can see miles in every direction --- ahead of me, that is. I should
not turn my head to disorient my set perspective. My decision is to sit
here in this position, without moving, for one year. And so far, it has
scarcely been a day. I hesitantly remind myself.</p>
<p>My eyes are not to move either, so my gaze rests on another
particular tree some distance down the hill. I become intimately
familiar with this tree. Since it is so far, my focus encompasses the
entire tree and not just a small part. I notice the style of its
branches, the contrast of its trunk's color to my scene's background,
the reflective texture of its leaves. But it is all with little clarity;
I find myself imagining hypotheses for what the details might be. "Is
there a crevice, there, in the trunk?" or "Was it that leaf that just
fell, or a leaf right behind it?" The distance frustrates my
inquiry.</p>
<p>About an hour into this exercise, I begin to notice a novel
phenomenon in my vision. The particulars of the tree, they seem... more
distinct to me now. The low-resolution pixels of my vision have slowly
refined, revealing a quality of definition that I've never imagined. It
is as if every minute nook in the tree's body was right in front of my
eyes, and simultaneously. I peer inside the nooks, noting their inner
texture of darker, wetter bark. My eyes begin to water at the density of
information. But soon the weak film over my eyes is eroded away by the
gentle-yet-persistent breeze. I presumed the film was functionally
important, but given these last few hours to make myself comfortable
with a new kind of sight, its removal has the effect of the removal of
the cap off a lens.</p>
<p>The sun tumbles over the horizon, darkness overcoming. At first I
fear that the lack of light will make my sleepless nights uninteresting,
but after a quick adjustment of three hours of darkness, my sight is up
to that sharp quality I'd become used to in the daytime. In fact, by the
time the sun begins to rise in the east, I can tell little difference
between the old dark and new light. Except that the new light is painful
for an hour.</p>
<p>I notice another novel phenomenon about eight hours later, the early
afternoon of my second day. Though my eyes have maintained their fixture
upon my tree at the bottom of the hill, it is no longer the bounds of my
visual focus, slowly becoming. I first notice the tiniest bit a variance
--- that I am able to analyze the colors, texture and shape of
neighboring trees just outside my immediate focal point. At such a
distance, this requires immense attention, and tires me quickly. And
then I relax for a moment, and feel my attention expand to immediately
and effortlessly encompass those neighboring trees. Was this
breakthrough at the success of my trained attention, or at the failure
of it?</p>
<p>With my visual focus expanded just ever so much, my whole visual
perspective shifts frames. Previously, I had been meditatively focussing
on a tree in the distance along with peripheral fragments of its peers.
Now, I am squinting from the inside of an blurred glass sphere with a
minuscule clear spot in front of me kept just large enough to allow a
distant tree and haphazard parts of its peers. This shift-of-perspective
is sudden, and my next attentive action is just as sudden. I wipe away
the dirty blur by expanding my attention in the same way I might have
otherwise moved my eyes. The degrees of freedom are exhilarating. I
notice for the first time the grass on the earth around me, the surface
of the tree next to me, the cardinality of the clouds above, the
smoothness of the lake off in the distance to my left. Areas of my
attention escape the realm of vision, and incorporate other senses as
well. The same microscopic detail I extracted of my originally-focussed
tree I see, feel, hear, smell, and taste all around me.</p>
<p>I must have failed to notice nightfall again, because now the sun
rises in a mark of the end of my first week. After just the first few
days, it became easy to designate a line of leaves on the tips of trees
along a mountain in the eastern distance to serve as measures of the
sun's progression longitudinally across the horizon each morning. After
another week, the designation of these particular leaves has become so
natural to me that it appears that the very essence of their shape and
placement could stand for nothing else. Each leaf, in the context of the
others, resembles a particular date like a pictogram.</p>
<p>How do I pass the time? When the hours crawled by like miles of
walking, boredom ravished my willpower. I had barely enough to keep
boredom at bay for a day. I spent my hours studying my tree, but only
after just a couple days I knew every millimeter of the tree by memory,
and no enjoyably-disruptive squirrels appeared to call it home. When I
began to finally see around me, though, boredom became a vague memory. I
could not even attempt to relate to it now. In just being conscious,
endless content manifests around me. The hours tick by, so I avoid
counting them as to not feel rushed. The world around me was clearly
finite, but the sheer volume and density of things existing in parallel
all in my one experience forces me to more preemptively structure my
exploration. If I just randomly brush my attention around, I would never
get to it all. I would never satisfactorily cover every sandy indent in
the lake's coast, the life of every hair on every animal in the borough
hosted among the roots of the forty-second tree off to the northwest. I
need to learn each of these things in their proper and complete
order.</p>
<p>I seldom can notice the change from day to night anymore. The
give-away used to be the appearance and disappearance of shadows, but
the shadows' paths have become so familiar to me that no matter their
position they look like the same familiar shadows I expected them to be.
My attention is busy unfolding the experience of novel things, and has
little time to benchmark my progress by fully understood shadow-paths.
The sun and moon's journeys through the sky have come to appear as
luminous streaks, where I can only discern the celestial body's exact
position if I take a momentary break from my usual investigations.</p>
<p>Now it is not that the breeze feels faster and stronger, or that the
sun and moon cross the sky more quickly, or that the young plants at my
feet sprout in a more animal-like way, compared to before my seating.
Time passes at the same rate as it always has. What is so phenomenally
new about my experience is the unmitigated throughput of my sensory
intake. There is so much detail at different levels of temporal analysis
that I start failing to notice that which is only relevant
second-to-second. The growth of bark on a young sapling is an exciting
thing to watch, but only if you are attentive to the day-by-day.</p>
<p>But why be restricted to this? Why not week-by-week? Year-by-year? I
consider the sapling again, the particular one down in the grove next to
the toads' home and the collection of rocks I have not looked into yet.
I want to see this fledgling tree bloom. The environment around the tree
is fuzzy like grass in the distance, but also applied to the rocks and
animals and other plants. This sapling in particular though is so
precise and full of intent. It sways back and forth to the sun. Mosses
and mushrooms skitter across the sapling's thin skin. It looses a few
nascent branches, but extrudes new ones in quick order. Finally it takes
for mature heights in a decade's quick spurt, finding new strength in
the divergence, due to abrupt rock erosion, of a nearby stream towards
its root system. The tree stretches its sprawling roots into the warm,
moist dirt, feeling for all the best spots. It awakes in the rolling
springs and reaches its branches in all directions to soak up the sweet
sunlight.</p>
