<p>The story of Aya Koike’s pursuit for love.</p>
<p>As a young girl, Aya is conditioned by her father to believe herself
fundamentally undeserving. Her father, a respected Christian authority,
lusts for her body but holds himself back from actually raping her. He
removes to take out his internal conflict on her, whipping Aya and
commanding her to confess that her body is obscene; obscene, in his
eyes, for tempting him away his fundamental religious values; obscene,
in her eyes, for the sinful feelings and monstrous men that it brings
her.</p>
<p>Agonizingly screaming “give it to me” on command by her father that
she beg for a soul, while he convinces himself that she is maliciously
seducing him, Aya discovers that love is sinful. So when she feels a
spark of affection between herself and a classmate, the only response
that comes to her is, first a masochism for allowing herself to have
such sinful ideas and feelings --- she slits deep into her wrists with a
box cutter while looking adoringly in his direction. Second a murderous
vengeance against him for sparking this inside her --- later, in the
bathroom after confessing love to each other and beginning to have sex,
she slits his throat with the same knife, then wanders the school
hallways, covered in his blood, and reminds the other students that
“fucking is a sin.. to be fucked is a sin…”</p>
<p>Aya has a finality with her father. Returning from the mental
hospital after her murderous incident at school, she finds him laying
helpless on the bed in the grips of a stroke, and with a stiff erection.
As she ponders this opportunity, she finds herself unable to draw her
attention away from his penis. After all the abuse, he has taught her to
be so thoroughly afraid of his instrument, but here it was, available to
her any whim. She thinks of her father more in terms of his penis than
in any other terms. She plays with his penis thoughtfully, and even
pretends to have sex with him. Finally she resolves to spare this
monster after all, but not the man. In perhaps the most gruesome way
possible, she first snaps his erection with her hands, and then uses a
common pair of scissors to finish off the castration.</p>
<p>With the deed done, she calls the police and gives them a ridiculous
excuse for what happened --- her father fell down and hurt his penis, so
she decide to cut it off to help ease the pain. But, apparently the ruse
works. Aya never sees her father again, the last time being when she
laughed over his dying, or perhaps already dead body, on a hospital
bed.</p>
<p>Through with the Christian demon that mentally raped and physically
all-but raped her, she is free. She still knows that she is fundamental
undeserving, which makes her well positioned to accept the 0 Church.
Soon after she is set free, she encounters the the leader of a new cult,
the 0 Church. The exact teachings of 0 are never clear, but the central
focus is on recognizing one’s own sins and accepting the utter
forgiveness of God, conditional on you aiding the 0 Church’s practices
and requirements. Aya allows herself to be taken in by the 0 Church’s
charismatic leader, but she never accepts the practices. She sees 0 for
the manipulative cult that it is, and as an opportunity to take
advantage of. She fully admits to her sins, but does not accept the
forgiveness of God --- the God that was her father.</p>
<p>Aya learns to use the Church for her own sadistic ends. She develops
a charisma herself, dead set on acquiring money and recruits for the 0
Church by whatever means possible. She runs a fake charity, sells fake
religious artifacts, and even deals cocaine. But nothing, not even her
power and success at 0, truly satisfies her. Eventually she realizes
that what she actually craves, and has been subconsciously striving for
by manipulating others, is to be genuinely desired by someone. Growing
more mature, she can no longer fully suppressed her urges to actually
feel deserved, to find a love that replaces the nightmares of her
father’s twisted lust. But she sees no man that can offer this.</p>
<p>Then one day, Aya meets the upskirt-photographer Yu Honda. She is
slightly annoyed that Yu takes some photos of her panties, at first
dismissing him as another common pervert among men, but he provokes
Aya’s curiosity when she notices that he appears to take no perverted
pleasure in the subject and instead treats it as a sort of challenging
exercise. She stalks him to his home, and then to the church of Yu’s
father. In the pouring rain, it’s unclear what exactly he is doing, so
she and her assistants approach him at last. He offers no resistance.
Aya’s assistants assume that Aya wants to beat him up because of the
panty photos, but Aya surprisingly decides to forgive him instead. She
sees that there is something special about this male, who appears not to
necessarily be a another dick-guided demon even though he otherwise acts
just like one. When she announces her forgiveness for him, a jolt of
warmth runs through her, something she did not know how to respond to,
but she smiles. All Aya shows is that she is fascinated with the boy,
and that she needed to keep his virginity pure for herself.</p>
<p>Most importantly, she needs to uncover Yu’s love. However, Aya knows
that she could not instigate it herself. So, she profile’s Yu and
identifies his perfect and convenient mate: a girl named Yoko with a
similarly tragic upbringing complete with a sexually abusive father an
abrasive relationship with religion. An in fact, Aya picks Yoko because
Aya sees herself in the girl, and sees the same spark for love with Yu
that she sees in herself.</p>
<p>Aya orchestrates Yu and Yoko’s fall into love, but making sure that
they cannot get too physically close so as to ruin Yu’s purity. In the
first stage of the orchestration, Yu is forced to conceal his identity
behind Miss Scorpion in order to not drive away Yoko due to an
instinctual hatred of men that Aya knows all too well. In the second
stage, Aya socially engineers the merging of Yu and Yoko’s families and
infiltrates the home. But, Aya gets a little tempted by the strength and
genuineness of Yoko’s lesbian love, and so indulges in sensual desires
with her. Aya is not skilled at showing affection, and it comes very
awkwardly to her. But in finally having sensuality with Yoko’s body, she
tries to learn from and absorb some of Yoko’s love. As a side effect,
she demonstrates to Yu that he cannot have Yoko after all. And all the
while that Aya is in the home, she cannot draw her attention away from
Yu. She spies on him, searches through his room, and tries to mildly
seduce him. But she can see that Yu’s love for Yoko is persistent, even
though she wants nothing to do with him. This fascinates Aya even more,
but worries her that it may be hard to separate them. So when Yu pulls
and ultimatum and reveals the identity of Miss Scorpion to Yoko, Aya
finally pulls the family into the 0 Church and cuts them away from Yu.
And with Yoko under her control, Away can manipulate Yu into coming to
her.</p>
<p>After thoroughly programming Yoko and the parents, Aya releases Yoko
back into the public so that Yu may find her and lose hope at last. Yu
is surprisingly persistent, but it is to no avail as he is unable to
unprogram Yoko. She has been thoroughly convinced that Yu’s interest in
her is purely perverted, evidenced by the uncontrollable erection that
Yu gets whenever he sees her. Aya even seems to pressure Yoko into
cutting off Yu’s penis, in a reflective act to the one she performed on
her own father, but Yoko cannot bring herself to and Aya does not push
her further. She knows that Yoko’s only hesitation was due to confusion,
stress, and calorie restriction, otherwise she could have been easily
pressured into castrating Yu. But, Aya does not want Yu castrated, she
just wants Yu to know that Yoko is hopeless and even dangerous to
him.</p>
<p>Aya continues to use Yoko as a remote control for Yu, and eventually
brings Yu into the 0 Church. Yu is allowed some exposure to Yoko, and
Aya uses these meetings as more opportunity to point out the perversion
of Yu’s love for Yoko. Aya is starting to become concerned that this has
gone too far, and that she is losing control of Yu even though he is so
close. The only way she knows to sexually communicate are in terms of
abuse and perversion. She does not want to lose Yu to Yoko, so she must
declare the relationship perverse and do everything she can to make them
turn away from each other. But, Aya is failing. At this point, Aya tries
to seduce Yu more and more. Even though she has told him how perverse
his erection is in front of Yoko, she tells him its okay to be erect
when Yu is with Aya. She even takes many opportunities to feel his hard
penis. The final stage of Aya’s orchestration is now to turn Yu’s
undying love away from Yoko and towards herself. But, no matter what she
tries, from cultish indoctrination and psychological abuse, nothing
works. Yu’s dedication to Yoko is unwavering.</p>
<p>Aya realizes that there must be a miracle to change Yu’s mind. He
must come to a point where he truly sees that Yoko’s love is impossible.
So, she gathers the parents and Yoko together, for Yu to come and find
and discover that his feelings for Yoko and relationships with his
parents are hopeless, and that love with Aya is the only option.</p>
<p>Yu makes it to the room as planned, having brutally fought off many
of the 0 Church’s security in a slashing frenzy, but is finally subdued.
Aya focuses only on Yu now. She has him so close. This is the final step
to bring them together. She just needs to tear his previous expectations
for love and then fill that void herself. Yu detonates a bomb somewhere
in the building, and Aya starts to panic realizing time is almost up.
Soon Yoko has Yu on the ground under her, trying to choke him out of his
crazy love for her for the last time. Yoko is so filled with rage that
she threw off some security to do this final act herself. As Yu slowly
loses breath, still calling out Yoko’s name, Yu snaps. He realizes that
Yoko is not going to stop. She is utterly beyond his reach. In that
moment his love dies. And Aya sees it. She sees the love leave Yu’s
mind. He throws off Yoko and combats in futile with the security. But
when Yu’s love vanishes, Aya sees that there is no void left for her to
fill. Aya sees that Yu is just like herself now --- an empty shell no
longer able to experience that such as love. She had killed off the love
that she had so desperately wanted, which she had only a taste of
through Yoko, but could not internalize and so had Yu’s purity was no
longer a treasure to preserve for herself, but a fate sealed beyond her
power.</p>
<p>Aya’s only drive bled away as madness consumed Yu’s pupils. She had
closed her hand too hard around what she now realized was a delicate
specialness in Yu, forever lost. For a brief moment, it Yu reminds Aya
of herself --- giving up hope in love and seeing it for the perverse
obscenity that it always is. In Yu’s insanity, she sees a familiarity
and realizes that she has been insane since she joined 0. In a hopeless
plea, she begs to the Yu in her imagination “give it to me… give it to
me…” --- the only language to express her emotional unmaking. Aya
reserves a small smile and cry as the same warmth that she first felt
from Yu fills her again along the edge of a katana.</p>
