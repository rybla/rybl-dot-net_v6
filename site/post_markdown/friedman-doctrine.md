## Introduction

In 1970, the New York Times published a Milton Friedman op-ed by the name of _A
Friedman dotrine-- The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its
Profits_ [[NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html)]. It begins with this paragraph.

> When I hear businessmen speak eloquently about the "social responsibilities of
> business in a free‐enterprise system," I am reminded of the wonderful line

Friedman's motivating observations are:

- Businessmen admit that corporations have social responsibilities, which must
  be met in order to defend free enterprise/
- The burdening of business with social responsibility is "unadulterated
  socialism," which has been undermining the basis for a free society.

Though the introduction draws on Friedman's view that socialism undermines the
basis for a free society, he does not argue that in the article. His thesis has
three components:

1. For-profit businesses _do not_ have a responsibility to do social good.
2. For-profit businesses _do_ have a responsibility to make profit i.e. "there
   is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources
   and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays
   within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free
   competition without deception fraud."
3. The endorsement of social responsibility for businesses amounts to socialism
   i.e. "the doctrine of 'social responsibility' involves the acceptance of the
   socialist view that political mechanisms, not market mechanisms, are the
   appropriate way to determine the allocation of scarce resources to alternative
   uses."

I am disposed to sympathize with many of Friedman's conclusions, however, there
are many points in his arguments which I find confusing, difficult, and/or just
wrong. Given my takes, and the context of _A Friedman Doctrine_'s being a
popular reference for describing "soulless capitalism," I write this article in
order to:

- clarify Friedman's point of view -- his formalizations and arguments
- dispell common misinterpretations
- give my own judgements
- propose some extensions and other modifications of Friedman's that address my
  criticisms

## A Friedman Doctrine

In this section I present an outline of Friedman's arguments, along with my own
elaborations on his formalizations.

### Social Responsibility

TODO

### Corporate Responsibility

TODO

### Socialism and "The Cloak of Social Responsibility"

TODO

### Caveats

my own judgements, extensions

## Judgements

### No Collective Responsibility

- I like his point of view on this, because I think collectivization of
  responsibility is a huge flaw in many popular arguments about economics,
  social justice (and even _economic justice_? lol).

- "There are no 'social' values, no 'social' responsibilities in any sense other
  than the shared values and responsibilities of individuals. Society is a
  collection of individuals and of the various groups they voluntarily form."
  - Ok, then why is it a problem if businesspeople voluntarily take on social
    responsibilities?

### A Special Social Responsibility?

- So does the argument come down to that corporate exec's have a _special_
  social responsibility, beyond being normal humans? This doesn't quite make
  sense, but Friedman does not address this fact because he does boil down the
  "social responsibility of business" to be the social responsibility of the
  businessmen.

### Principles of Effectiveness

- Though Friedman is most loud about the moral principles behind a his defense
  of what he calls altogether "a basis for a free society," he also claims many
  times that a free-market system is the most effective at producing social
  goods as well.
  - Then there is easily the counterfactual point that: if there is a case when
    it would be more effective to impose a social responsibility on a business,
    or just give control to the government entirely, why would we not do it? It
    does not an unprincipled contention, because it relies on another principle
    that Friedman admits -- efficiency.
  - Friedman claim "There is nothing that could do more in a brief period to
    destroy a market system and replace it by a centrally controlled system than
    effective governmental control of prices and wages" and I agree. But surely
    there are particular submarkets that might be better to be replaced by
    centrally controlled systems? Almost all libertarians, such as Friedman,
    agree that certain privelages should be handed off to the government for a
    variety of reasons e.g. police, military, democratic rule. Why could there
    not be any submarket that also meets similar criteria?

## Extensions
